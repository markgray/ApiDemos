Accessibility
  Accessibility/Accessibility Node Querying  v14
        .accessibility.TaskListActivity
        .accessibility.TaskListView
        .accessibility.TaskAdapter new so that kotlin can find it
        .layout.tasklist_main.xml
        .layout.tasklist_row.xml
            Starts up the task list that will interact with the AccessibilityService sample.
            TaskListView acts as a go-between for all AccessibilityEvents sent from items in its
            ListView, providing the option of sending more context to an AccessibilityService
            by adding more AccessibilityRecords to an event.

  Accessibility/Accessibility Service  v14
        .accessibility.ClockBackActivity
        .accessibility.ClockBackService
        .layout.accessibility_service.xml
            This is the entry activity for a sample that demonstrates how to implement an
            AccessibilityService, namely the ClockBackService

  Accessibility/Custom View           v14
        .accessibility.CustomViewAccessibilityActivity
        .layout.custom_view_accessibility.xml
            Demonstrates how to implement accessibility support of custom views. Custom view
            is a tailored widget developed by extending the base classes in the android.view
            package. This sample shows how to implement the accessibility behavior via both
            inheritance (non backwards compatible) and composition (backwards compatible).
            While the Android framework has a diverse portfolio of views tailored for various
            use cases, sometimes a developer needs a specific functionality not implemented
            by the standard views. A solution is to write a custom view that extends one of the
            base view classes. While implementing the desired functionality a developer should
            also implement accessibility support for that new functionality such that
            disabled users can leverage it.

  Accessibility/MagnificationService v24
        .accessibility.MagnificationService
        .xml.magnification_service.xml
            This class is an AccessibilityService that controls the state of display 
            magnification in response to key events. It demonstrates the following key features
            of the Android accessibility APIs:
               Basic implementation of an AccessibilityService
               Observing and respond to user-generated key events
               Querying and modifying the state of display magnification
            It includes the file xml/magnification_service.xml describing the service, which is
            referenced by a meta-data android:name="android.accessibilityservice"
            android:resource="@xml/magnification_service" element in AndroidManifest.xml.

Animation (disabled for froyo)
  Animation/Activity Transition v21+
        .animation.ActivityTransition Becomes:
        .layout.image_block.xml
    Animation/Details of a specific thingy v21+
        .animation.ActivityTransitionDetails
        .layout.image_details.xml
            Uses ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation to transition using
            a shared view as the epicenter of the transition. The xml sets
            android:onClick="clicked" to use for each thumbnail in the GridLayout
            and clicked() creates an intent to launch ActivityTransitionDetails.class
            using a bundle containing an ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation()
            which causes the thumbnail to "expand" into the image detail version. When the
            ImageView in the image detail version is clicked, the reverse transition to
            ActivityTransition activity occurs. The animation is set up using AndroidManifest
            android:theme="@style/ActivityTransitionTheme" which contains elements which point
            to files in res/transition

  Animation/Bouncing Balls v11+
        .animation.BouncingBalls
        .animation.ShapeHolder
        .layout.bouncing_balls.xml
            Uses several different kinds of ObjectAnimator to animate bouncing 
            color changing balls. When onTouchEvent is called with either a
            MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN or MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE a ball of random
            color is added at the events event.getX(), event.getY() coordinates.
            The ball motion and geometry is animated, then an animator of the balls
            alpha is played fading it out from an alpha of 1.0 to 0.0 in 250 milliseconds.
            The onAnimationEnd callback of the fade animation is set to an
            AnimatorListenerAdapter which removes the ball when the animation is done.
            The background color is also Animated. Note that setting the background color
            will automatically invalidate the view, so that the animated color, and the
            bouncing balls, get redisplayed on every frame of the background color animation.

  Animation/Cloning v11 
        .animation.AnimationCloning
        .layout.animation_cloning.xml
        .animation.ShapeHolder
            Creates an ObjectAnimator to animate the y position of an object from 0 to the
            bottom of the View, .clones it and uses .setTarget to set it as the animation
            of a second View. Then it creates two ObjectAnimator's to: animate the y position
            of an object down, and a second to animate y position up again and creates an AnimatorSet
            to play them sequentially, clones this AnimatorSet and .setTarget's the clone as the
            AnimatorSet for a second object. Uses an AnimatorSet to play the first two ObjectAnimator's
            and first AnimatorSet, requesting that they be run at the same time by calling
            playTogether(ObjectAnimator1,ObjectAnimator2,AnimatorSet1), and the second AnimatorSet
            to run after the first AnimatorSet by calling playSequentially(AnimatorSet1,AnimatorSet2).

  Animation/Custom Evaluator v11 
        .animation.CustomEvaluator
        .layout.animator_custom_evaluator.xml
        .animation.ShapeHolder
            Implements the TypeEvaluator interface to animate using a custom:
            "public Object evaluate(float fraction, Object startValue, Object endValue)"
            function. The x and y coordinates of an "animation.ShapeHolder ball" are 
            animated by calling evaluate, and onAnimationUpdate is called which calls
            invalidate() which causes the onDraw method to be called.

  Animation/Default Layout Animations v11 -- layout uses GridLayout so crash,  if < v14.
        .animation.LayoutAnimationsByDefault
        .layout.layout_animations_by_default.xml
            Uses android:animateLayoutChanges="true" in the GridLayout used to contain buttons,
            to automate transition animations using the default animations as Buttons are added
            to or removed from that ViewGroup.            .

  Animation/Events v11
        .animation.AnimatorEvents
        .layout.animator_events.xml
            Supposed to show when the various Sequencer Events and Animator Events: 
            Start Repeat Cancel and End occur, but Repeat Events are not generated
            for the Sequencer because the api does not support setRepeatCount on a
            AnimatorSet.

  Animation/Hide-Show Animations v11
        .animation.LayoutAnimationsHideShow
        .layout_animations_hideshow.xml
            Uses setLayoutTransition to set default transitions, and setAnimator to 
            specify custom animations if checkbox is checked. Buttons disappear when
            touched using these animations. If "Gone" checkbox is checked, 
            setVisibility is used to set the button's view to View.GONE which means 
            that it takes up no layout space, and the remaining buttons move together
            to fill the now empty space, otherwise it is set to View.INVISIBLE which
            makes it invisible, but it still occupies the same layout space.
            Pressing the "Show Buttons" button while the "Custom Animations" CheckBox 
            is checked causes a crash which blanks out the system wallpaper. (Sometimes?)

  Animation/Layout Animations v11
        .animation.LayoutAnimations
        .animation.FixedGridLayout
        .layout.layout_animations.xml
            Adds and removes buttons using custom or default animations. Custom animations crash
            badly, causing temporary problem for system wallpaper on Pixel

  Animation/Loading v11 -> v23 or higher required due to android:fraction="0"
        .animation.AnimationLoading
        .animation.ShapeHolder
        .layout.animation_loading.xml
            Loads animations from Xml files: R.animator.object_animator (animates ball[0] "y"
            from 0 to 200, and reverses), R.animator.animator (animates ball[1] alpha from 1 to
            0 and reverses), R.animator.animator_set (an animator set which animates ball[2]'s
            "x" from 0 to 200, and "y" from 0 to 400), R.animator.color_animator (an animator
            which animates ball[3]'s color from #0f0 to #00ffff), R.animator.object_animator_pvh
            (an animator which animates ball[4]'s "x" from 0 to 400, and "y" from 0 to 200 using
            propertyValuesHolder's), R.animator.object_animator_pvh_kf (uses propertyValuesHolder
            to hold keyframe specs for x and y and uses the default linear interpolator on balls[5]),
            R.animator.value_animator_pvh_kf (uses propertyValuesHolder to hold keyframe specs
            for a value which balls[6] uses in an AnimatorUpdateListener for an alpha animation),
            and R.animator.object_animator_pvh_kf_interpolated (the animation used for balls[7] has an
            accelerate interpolator applied on each keyframe interval instead of the default used on
            balls[5], As these two animations use the exact same path, the effect of the per-keyframe
            interpolator has been made obvious.)

  Animation/Multiple Properties v11
        .animation.MultiPropertyAnimation
        .animation.ShapeHolder
        .layout.animation_multi_property.xml
            Uses AnimatorSet.playTogether(Animator... items) to play four different 
            animations at once: yBouncer (animates y using a BounceInterpolator), yAlphaBouncer
            (animates y and alpha using an AccelerateInterpolator), whxyBouncer (animates width,
            height, x and y using PropertyValuesHolder's), and yxBouncer (animates y and x
            using Keyframe's to split the animation into three sections with a repeat count of
            one and setRepeatMode(ValueAnimator.REVERSE)), all of which are set up in the method
            createAnimation().

  Animation/Path Animations v11 -- uses android.util.Property crashes if < v14. Also 
        uses android.animation.ObjectAnimator crashes if < v21. Also extends abstract
        class android.animation.TypeConverter crashes if < v21.
        .animation.PathAnimations
        .layout.path_animations.xml
            Moves a frog around an android.graphics.Path using six different ways to move
            the View: named_components (Uses the named "x" and "y" properties for individual
            (x, y) coordinates of the Path and sets them on the view object. The setX(float)
            and setY(float) methods are called on view. An int version of this method also
            exists for animating int Properties), property_components (Use two Properties
            for individual (x, y) coordinates of the Path and set them on the view object.
            An int version of this method also exists for animating int Properties.),
            multi_int (Use a multi-int setter to animate along a Path. The method
            setCoordinates(int x, int y) is called on this during the animation. Either
            "setCoordinates" or "coordinates" are acceptable parameters because the "set"
            can be implied.), multi_float (Use a multi-float setter to animate along a Path.
            The method changeCoordinates(float x, float y) is called on this during the
            animation), named_setter (Use the named "point" property to animate along the Path.
            There must be a method setPoint(PointF) on the animated object. Because setPoint
            takes a PointF parameter, no TypeConverter is necessary. In this case, the animated
            object is PathAnimations.), and property_setter (Use the POINT_PROPERTY property
            to animate along the Path. POINT_PROPERTY takes a Point, not a PointF, so the
            TypeConverter PointFToPointConverter is necessary.). The radio buttons to choose
            which way to use need to be in an HorizontalScrollView not a ScrollView in order
            to be seen on narrow screens.

  Animation/Reversing v11
        .animation.ReversingAnimation
        .animation.ShapeHolder
        .layout.animation_reversing.xml
            Demonstrates the use of android.animation.ValueAnimator.reverse() method
            to play an animation in "reverse".

  Animation/Seeking v11
        .animation.AnimationSeeking
        .animation.ShapeHolder
        .layout.animation_seeking.xml
            Uses a SeekBar to allow user to set the animation to a particular position
            using android.animation.ValueAnimator.setCurrentPlayTime(long playTime)
            Pressing the Run button will play from the current position of the animation.

  Animation/Simple Transitions v11 -- TransitionInflater.from(this) requires v19 as does
        Scene.getSceneForLayout, as does android.transition itself.
        .animation.Transitions
        .layout.transition.xml
        .layout.transition_scene1.xml
        .layout.transition_scene2.xml
        .layout.transition_scene3.xml
        .transition.transitions_mgr.xml
            Uses classes from android.transition to animate transitions between 4 (or 3) 
            different layouts. scene4 is not an actual 'Scene', but rather a dynamic
            change in the UI, transitioned to using beginDelayedTransition() to tell
            the TransitionManager to get ready to run a transition at the next frame.
            It merely re-sizes four of the views in whichever of the first three Scenes
            happens to be displayed at that moment.

  Animation/View Flip v11
        .animation.ListFlipper
        .layout.rotating_list.xml
            Uses fancy custom ObjectAnimator to swap two list views occupying the same
            space in a LinearLayout, by setting one to android:visibility="gone" and the
            other to android:visibility="visible" when they are to be "flipped", the
            english list starts as the visible list as defined in the Layout xml file.

App
  Action Bar (All Disabled for Froyo)
    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Mechanics v11
        .app.ActionBarMechanics
            Populates its Action Bar programmatically with no xml files used, even
            for the Activity layout.

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Navigation v16 (new Document Flag requires v21)
        .app.ActionBarNavigation goes to:
        .app.ActionBarNavigationTarget
        .layout.action_bar_navigation.xml
        .layout.action_bar_navigation_target.xml
            Shows how to use "Up" button in the ActionBar. A new Document is created in a 
            separate activity, so you have to use "recent" to swipe away the activity that
            launched it, switch to the new "Document", and then the "up" button works as "up",
            otherwise it works as "Back". Uses the attribute android:taskAffinity=":bar_navigation" 
            to associate the activities.

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Tabs v11
        .app.ActionBarTabs
        .layout.action_bar_tabs.xml
        .layout.action_bar_tab_content.xml
            You need to toggle tab mode before tabs show in action bar. Crashes when rotated
            because it needs a zero argument constructor. The text should be passed in a bundle.
            Working on doing this Right. Did so, but need to use retained fragments in order
            to keep tabs (TODO: add retained fragments to this)

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Usage v11
        .app.ActionBarUsage
        .menu.actions.xml
            This demonstrates idiomatic usage of the Action Bar. The default Honeycomb theme
            includes the action bar by default and a menu resource is used to populate the
            menu data itself. If you'd like to see how these things work under the hood, see
            ActionBarMechanics. Shows a bunch of different action bar actions, and how to use
            and configure in both java and xml

    App/Action Bar/Action Provider/Settings Action Provider v14
        .app.ActionBarSettingsActionProviderActivity
            demo creates an ActionProvider for launching the system settings and adds
            a menu item with that provider, in this case it will launch the system
            settings app. Demonstrates how to implement an android.view.ActionProvider

    App/Action Bar/Action Provider/Share Action Provider v14
        .app.ActionBarShareActionProviderActivity
        .content.FileProvider
            Shows how to add a Share Action Provider to the Action Bar. Shares robot.png
            packaged with the app in res/raw by using content.FileProvider
            TODO: Broken for R -- need to look into this

    App/Action Bar/Display Options v16
        .app.ActionBarDisplayOptions
        .layout.action_bar_display_options.xml
        .layout.action_bar_display_options_custom.xml
        .menu.display_options_actions.xml
            Shows how various action bar display option flags can be combined and their
            effects. The flags are: DISPLAY_HOME_AS_UP, DISPLAY_SHOW_HOME, DISPLAY_USE_LOGO,
            DISPLAY_SHOW_TITLE, DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM, all fields in ActionBar. Also you
            can cycle the gravity of the Custom View from START->CENTER_HORIZONTAL->END->START,
            all fields in Gravity, as well as toggle the bar's visibility using ActionBar.hide()
            and ActionBar.show(), and toggle system ui visibility using setSystemUiVisibility(0)
            to make it visible, and setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN) to
            make it invisible.

  Activity
    App/Activity/Animation                 all
        .app.Animation
        .layout.activity_animation
        JELLY_BEAN (v16+) required for "modern animations" by java code if/else statement
        animates in to:
        .app.AlertDialogSamples
            Example of using a custom animation when transitioning between activities. 
            Legacy "Fade In" and "Zoom In" use:
            overridePendingTransition(int enterAnim, int exitAnim), where enterAnim and 
            exitAnim are the R.anim.* for xml files in res/anim, (R.anim.fade, R.anim.hold)
            for the "Fade In" animation, and (R.anim.zoom_enter, R.anim.zoom_exit) for 
            the "Zoom In" animation.
            The modern versions of these use ActivityOptions.makeCustomAnimation() and
            ActivityOptions.toBundle() to pass the animations to the startActivity function.
            The "Scale Up" animation uses ActivityOptions.makeScaleUpAnimation and the
            "Thumbnail Scale Up" animation uses ActivityOptions.makeThumbnailScaleUpAnimation
            to create options to bundle with toBundle to pass to the startActivity function.

    App/Activity/Custom Dialog             all
        .app.CustomDialogActivity
        .layout.custom_dialog_activity.xml
        style name="Theme.CustomDialog" -- element in values/styles.xml
            Creates a pop-up activity over the App/Activity list which looks like a dialog, and
            uses a android:theme="@style/Theme.CustomDialog" set in the AndroidManifest.

    App/Activity/Custom Title              v21 due to AppCompatActivity migration oddly enough
        .app.CustomTitle
        .layout.custom_title.xml
        .layout.custom_title_1.xml
            Used to be an example of how to use a custom title. Used Window.FEATURE_CUSTOM_TITLE
            to create a custom title bar from layout/custom_title_1 for the activity, and allowed
            the user to change the title. But when migrating to [AppCompatActivity] I found out that
            new versions will always throw a runtime exception: "You cannot combine custom titles
            with other title features", and there is no way to turn back the clock to the days when
            title bars were used instead of [ActionBar]'s (apart from targeting Api 7.0 instead of
            the latest). What I did instead is embed a CustomView in the Activity's [ActionBar].
            Looks and acts the same, but allows you to use all the other neat features of
            [AppCompatActivity].

    App/Activity/Dialog                    all
        .app.DialogActivity
        .layout.dialog_activity.xml
            Creates a Dialog using a style derived from a theme that is appropriate 
            and available given the Api level: style/ThemeCurrentDialog is defined in
            each: values/styles.xml values-v11/styles.xml values-v19/styles.xml and
            values-v20/styles.xml with the parent set to android:Theme.Dialog, 
            android:Theme.Holo.Dialog, android:Theme.Material.Dialog, and
            android:Theme.Material.Light.Dialog respectively.

    App/Activity/Finish Affinity           v16
        .app.FinishAffinity
        .layout.activity_finish_affinity.xml
            Show how to end a deeply nested stack of activities, returning to the 
            activity at the very top. It does this by calling finishAffinity() which
            finishes this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in 
            the current task that have the same affinity.

    App/Activity/Forwarding                all
        .app.Forwarding
        .layout.forwarding.xml
        .app.ForwardTarget
        .layout.forward_target.xml
            Example of removing yourself from the history stack after forwarding to 
            another activity. This is simply done by calling finish() after calling 
            startActivity(Intent).

    App/Activity/<b>Hello <i>World</i></b> all
        .app.HelloWorld
        .layout.hello_world.xml
            Simple app which only displays a layout containing a single TextView.

    App/Activity/Intent Activity Flags     all -> v11
        .app.IntentActivityFlags
        .layout.intent_activity_flags.xml
            This activity demonstrates how to build a backstack of activities into an
            array of Intent[] and use it to replace the current backstack by using 
            makeRestartActivityTask() to create Intent[0] with the flags set to 
            re-launch ApiDemos task in its base state, Intent[1] to launch ApiDemos
            at the "Views" "com.example.android.apis.Path", Intent[2] to launch
            ApiDemos at the "Views/Lists" "com.example.android.apis.Path" and requesting
            to reset the back stack to these three "activities". It then launches these
            intents using startActivities() if the FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK button is
            pressed, or putting them into a PendingIntent which it "later" calls using
            PendingIntent.send()

    App/Activity/Intents                   all
        .app.Intents
        .layout.intents.xml
            Uses Intent.createChooser(Intent, "title") to create a "chooser intent" 
            from three different mime types ("audio/*", "image/*", and "*/*") of
            Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT Intents based on which button the user clicks,
            and it then hands the created "chooser Intent" to startActivity(Intent)

    App/Activity/Max Aspect Ratio/1:1
        .app.MaxAspectRatio$Square
            Uses android:maxAspectRatio="1" in AndroidManifest.xml to set the aspect
            ratio of an empty MaxAspectRatio activity subclass Square

    App/Activity/Max Aspect Ratio/16:9
        .app.MaxAspectRatio$SixteenToNine
            Uses android:maxAspectRatio="1.77777778" in AndroidManifest.xml to set the aspect
            ratio of an empty MaxAspectRatio activity subclass SixteenToNine

    App/Activity/Max Aspect Ratio/Any
        .app.MaxAspectRatio$Any
            Uses no android:maxAspectRatio in AndroidManifest.xml to use any aspect
            ratio of an empty MaxAspectRatio activity subclass Any

    App/Activity/Overscan                  v18
        .app.OverscanActivity
        .layout.overscan_activity.xml
            Uses "@style/Theme.MyOverscanStyle" set in AndroidManifest, (which is my
            custom AppCompat version of @android:style/Theme.Holo.NoActionBar.Overscan)
            and android:fitsSystemWindows="true" in its layout/overscan_activity.xml to
            place a surrounding "white box" in the overscan region of the display, and
            displays a picture in a FrameLayout offset to avoid the overscan region.

   App/Activity/Persistent State          all
        .app.PersistentState
        .layout.save_restore_state
            Demonstrates saving and restoring activity state by using a
            SharedPreferences.Editor to save state in the onPause() callback, then 
            restoring the state in the onResume callback.

    App/Activity/Picture in Picture        v26
        .app.PictureInPicture
        .layout.picture_in_picture.xml
            Minimal demo of Picture in Picture mode, just enters that mode with current
            content view when button is clicked. You have to drag the PIP down instead of
            up in order to dismiss it -- well guarded secret until Android Q revealed it
            to me in a Toast.
 
    App/Activity/Presentation -- registerDisplayListener v17 getSupportedModes v23
        .app.PresentationActivity
        .layout.presentation_activity.xml
        .layout.presentation_content.xml
        .layout.presentation_list_item.xml
            Presents a presentation on a secondary display. (Needs secondary display.)

    App/Activity/Presentation with Media Router MediaRouter needs v17
        .app.PresentationWithMediaRouterActivity
        .layout.presentation_with_media_router_activity.xml
            The activity uses the MediaRouter API to automatically detect when a 
            presentation display is available and to allow the user to control the
            media routes using a menu item.  When a presentation display is available,
            we stop showing content in the main activity and instead open up a  
            Presentation on the preferred presentation display.

    App/Activity/QuickContactsDemo         all
        .app.QuickContactsDemo
        .layout.quick_contacts.xml
            Shows how to query the contacts database using a cursor, and display the
            results in a ListActivity hosted ListView. It uses a deprecated api which
            queries the database on the UI thread -- it is better to use LoaderManager
            with a CursorLoader. See the documentation for LoaderManager for an example
            of how to do this. TODO: write LoaderManager version.

    App/Activity/Receive Result            all
        .app.ReceiveResult
        .layout.receive_result.xml
        .app.SendResult
        .layout.send_result.xml
            Show how to start a second activity (.app.SendResult) to generate a result,
            receive it using startActivityForResult(intent, GET_CODE), followed on completion
            by the callback onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data).
            It launches the Activity SendResult, which then returns the result using
            setResult(RESULT_OK, (new Intent()).setAction("Corky!")), followed by
            finish().

    App/Activity/Recreate                  v11
        .app.ActivityRecreate
        .layout.activity_recreate.xml
            Uses setTheme(theme) followed by recreate() to cycle through three different 
            Holo themes (original version did not initialize the field that the current 
            theme is kept in, causing it to crash on Material Light default devices.)

    App/Activity/Redirection               all
        .app.RedirectEnter
        .layout.redirect_enter.xml
        .app.RedirectGetter
        .layout.redirect_getter.xml
        .app.RedirectMain
        .layout.redirect_main.xml
            Consists of three activities: RedirectEnter, RedirectGetter, and RedirectMain.
            RedirectGetter stores user input in the shared preference file "RedirectData"
            RedirectEnter just describes what will happen, and when the "Go" button is 
            clicked starts up RedirectMain, which immediately starts RedirectGetter if 
            there is no data stored in "RedirectData" yet, if there is data it will display
            it and give the user the options to either "Clear and Exit" back to RedirectEnter,
            or "New Text" which restarts RedirectGetter. RedirectMain uses the request 
            codes INIT_TEXT_REQUEST, and NEW_TEXT_REQUEST that it sends in the Intent to 
            RedirectGetter to determine what to do if the result code was RESULT_CANCELED,
            either finish() back to RedirectEnter, or just display the old text.

    App/Activity/Reorder Activities        all
        .app.ReorderOnLaunch
        .layout.reorder_on_launch.xml
        .app.ReorderTwo
        .layout.reorder_two.xml
        .app.ReorderThree
        .layout.reorder_three.xml
        .app.ReoderFour
        .layout.reorder_four.xml
            ReorderOnLaunch is the first of a sequence of four Activities: ReorderTwo,
            ReorderThree, and ReoderFour follow.  A button on the fourth will use the 
            Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT flag to bring the second of the 
            activities to the front of the history stack. After that, proceeding back
            through the history should begin with the newly-frontmost second reorder 
            activity, then the fourth, the third, and finally the first.

    App/Activity/Rotation Animation        v26+ or crash
        .app.RotationAnimation
        .layout.rotation_animation.xml
            Allows you to choose the animation that occurs when the screen is rotated:
            either ROTATION_ANIMATION_ROTATE, ROTATION_ANIMATION_CROSSFADE, ROTATION_ANIMATION_JUMPCUT,
            or ROTATION_ANIMATION_SEAMLESS.

    App/Activity/Save &amp; Restore State  all
        .app.SaveRestoreState
        .layout.save_restore_state.xml
            Broken? Or too much memory for a kill needed?
            Supposed to show that only EditText with an "id" assigned to the view will
            have its state preserved, but both EditText views remember text entered after
            switching to another app and back. However if you rotate screen then only the
            state of the EditText with android:freezesText="true" is saved, the new content
            of other EditText is forgotten.

    App/Activity/Screen Orientation        all -- v18+ required for full use
        .app.ScreenOrientation
        .layout.screen_orientation.xml
            Lets the user choose the screen orientation programmatically -- some orientations
            are only available for v9+, and some only for v18+ but froyo ignores them rather 
            than crashes. Very nice example of spinner layout and use.

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Dialog          all
        .app.SecureDialogActivity
        .layout.secure_dialog_activity.xml
            Shows a secure dialog by setting WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE on an
            AlertDialog before calling dialog.show()

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Surface View    all
        .app.SecureSurfaceViewActivity                  v17+ or Crash
        .layout.secure_surface_view_activity.xml
        .graphics.CubeRenderer
            This activity demonstrates how to make a SurfaceView use a secure surface so 
            that its contents will only be visible on secure displays. The surface view's
            window has been made secure using setSecure(true) to make it use a secure 
            surface.

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Window          all
        .app.SecureWindowActivity
        .layout.secure_window_activity.xml
            This activity demonstrates how to make an activity use a secure surface so
            that its contents will only be visible on secure displays. The activity's 
            window has been marked with FLAG_SECURE by calling:

            getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE,
                                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE);

            in the onCreate callback just after calling setContentView to make it use
            a secure surface.

    App/Activity/SetWallpaper              all
        .app.SetWallpaperActivity
        .layout.wallpaper_2.xml
            This demonstrates the how to write an activity that gets the current system 
            wallpaper, modifies it and sets the modified bitmap as system wallpaper. The
            image it uses is too small for larger screens because the current wallpaper
            is compressed to fit in the ImageView used by the layout, which is then used
            to set the new wallpaper.

    App/Activity/Soft Input Modes          all
        .app.SoftInputModes
        .layout.soft_input_modes.xml
            Shows how the various soft input modes: "Unspecified" (The system will try to
            pick one or the other depending on the contents of the window); "Resize"
            (allow the window to be resized when an input method is shown, so that its
            contents are not covered by the input method); "Pan" (window will pan when
            an input method is shown, so it doesn't need to deal with resizing but is just
            panned by the framework to ensure the current input focus is visible); and
            "Nothing" (window will not adjust for a shown input method. The window will
            not be resized, and it will not be panned to make its focus visible) effect
            the resizing of the UI windows when the IME is displayed. They are set with:
            getWindow().setSoftInputMode(mResizeModeValues[position])

    App/Activity/Translucent               all
        .app.TranslucentActivity
        .layout.translucent_background.xml
            Sets the theme on the window in AndroidManifest to @style/Theme.MyThemeTranslucent
            which is defined in values/styles.xml, its parent is "Theme.AppCompat" with attribute
            items copied from android:style/Theme.Translucent, thereby causing the window to be
            composited over whatever is behind it.

    App/Activity/Translucent Blur          all Not Blurred enough on lollipop
        .app.TranslucentBlurActivity
        .layout.translucent_background.xml
            This is the same as .app.TranslucentActivity, with the background blurred on
            older api's - WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_BLUR_BEHIND is no longer 
            supported as of API level 14, so Lollipop does not blur at all.

    App/Activity/Wallpaper                 all
        .app.WallpaperActivity
        .layout.translucent_background.xml
            This is an app which has the system wallpaper behind it. It does this by 
            setting the theme on the window in AndroidManifest to Theme.MyThemeWallpaper,
            which copies attributes from the system theme android:style/Theme.Wallpaper,
            which has android:windowShowWallpaper = "true":

            <style name="Theme.MyThemeWallpaper"
                    parent="Theme.AppCompat">
                    <item name="android:windowBackground">@android:color/transparent</item>
                    <item name="android:colorBackgroundCacheHint">@null</item>
                    <item name="android:windowShowWallpaper">true</item>
                    <item name="android:colorForeground">#fff</item>
                </style>

  Alarm
    App/Alarm/Alarm Controller             v23
        .app.AlarmController
        ..layout.alarm_controller.xml
        .app.OneShotAlarm
        .app.RepeatingAlarm
            Shows how to schedule both one-shot alarms (OneShotAlarm.java), and repeating
            alarms (RepeatingAlarm.java) using AlarmManager.set() for one-shot and 
            AlarmManager.setRepeating() for the repeating alarm. OneShotAlarm and RepeatingAlarm
            are declared as <receiver>'s in AndroidManifest.xml

    App/Alarm/Alarm Service                v26
        .app.AlarmService
        .layout.alarm_service.xml
        .app.AlarmServiceService
            This demonstrates how you can schedule an alarm that causes a service to be
            started (.app.AlarmService_Service)  This is useful when you want to schedule 
            alarms that initiate long-running operations, such as retrieving recent e-mails.
            Note: as of API 19, all repeating alarms are inexact. If your application needs
            precise delivery times then it must use one-time exact alarms, rescheduling each
            time. Legacy applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will
            continue to have all of their alarms, including repeating alarms, treated as exact.

  Alert Dialogs
    App/Alert Dialogs                      all (v11+ or crash for some)
        .app.AlertDialogSamples
        .layout.alert_dialog.xml
            Allows you to create different types of dialogs: DIALOG_YES_NO_MESSAGE = 1;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_LONG_MESSAGE = 2; DIALOG_LIST = 3; DIALOG_PROGRESS = 4;
            DIALOG_SINGLE_CHOICE = 5; DIALOG_MULTIPLE_CHOICE = 6; DIALOG_TEXT_ENTRY = 7;
            DIALOG_MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CURSOR = 8; DIALOG_YES_NO_ULTRA_LONG_MESSAGE = 9;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_OLD_SCHOOL_MESSAGE = 10; DIALOG_YES_NO_HOLO_LIGHT_MESSAGE = 11;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_DEFAULT_LIGHT_MESSAGE = 12; DIALOG_YES_NO_DEFAULT_DARK_MESSAGE = 13;
            and DIALOG_PROGRESS_SPINNER = 14. It does this by calling showDialog with the
            int identifying the dialog to be shown, and overriding "Dialog onCreateDialog(int id)"
            which uses a switch to branch between code needed to create the Dialog which it
            returns. All this is very deprecated - TODO: Write a DialogFragment version.

  Device Admin
    App/Device Admin                       Works only on newer versions(?) v24+ or crash
        .app.DeviceAdminSample
        .xml.device_admin_headers.xml
        .xml.device_admin_general.xml
        .xml.device_admin_quality.xml
        .xml.device_admin_expiration.xml
        .xml.device_admin_lock_wipe.xml
        .xml.device_admin_encryption.xml
            Shows how to implement a comprehensive UI for exploring and operating the 
            DevicePolicyManager api.
            TODO: work up enough courage to play around with this (lem?)

  Fragment                                 v11+ for all samples
    App/Fragment/Alert Dialog              v11
        .app.FragmentAlertDialog
        .layout.fragment_dialog.xml
            Demonstrates how to show an AlertDialog that is managed by a Fragment. Uses
            DialogFragment as base class and overrides onCreateDialog in which it builds
            the AlertDialog using an AlertDialog.Builder

    App/Fragment/Arguments                 v11
        .app.FragmentArguments
        .app.FragmentArgumentsFragment only used in FragmentNestingTabs.java
        .layout.fragment_arguments_fragment.xml
        .layout.fragment_arguments.xml
            Demonstrates a fragment that can be configured through both Bundle arguments
            and layout attributes. Different layout in landscape, including an extra 
            fragment configured within the landscape layout only.

    App/Fragment/Context Menu              v11
        .app.FragmentContextMenu
        .layout.fragment_context_menu.xml
            Demonstration of displaying a context menu from a fragment.

    App/Fragment/Custom Animations         v11 -> v21 due to getDrawable call
        .app.FragmentCustomAnimations
        .layout.fragment_stack.xml
        .layout.hello_world.xml
            Uses FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimations to cause animations to be used
            when replacing one fragment with the next. The "POP" button does the same thing
            as the back button by calling onBackPressed, it takes you back through the numbered
            fragments on the stack after you "Push" them, again using the same animation.
            onSaveInstanceState saves the mStackLevel in an int "level" which is used when
            the Activity is recreated to remember the stack level, mStackLevel is then used
            to set the int argument "num" passed to the new fragment when it is created.

    App/Fragment/Dialog                    v11
        .app.FragmentDialog
        .layout.fragment_dialog.xml
            Example of displaying dialogs with a DialogFragment. Press the show button
            at the bottom to see the first dialog; pressing successive show buttons on 
            the dialogs will display other dialog styles as a stack, with back going to
            the previous dialog. The various styles are: STYLE_NO_TITLE; STYLE_NO_FRAME;
            STYLE_NO_INPUT (this window can't receive input, so you will need to press 
            the bottom show button); STYLE_NORMAL with dark fullscreen theme; STYLE_NORMAL
            with light theme; STYLE_NO_TITLE with light theme; STYLE_NO_FRAME with light 
            theme; STYLE_NORMAL with light fullscreen theme; and STYLE_NORMAL.

    App/Fragment/Dialog or Activity        v11
        .app.FragmentDialogOrActivity
        .layout.fragment_dialog_or_activity.xml
            Shows how to show the same DialogFragment embedded in the activity layout,
            and as a dialog.

    App/Fragment/Hide and Show             v11
        .app.FragmentHideShow
        .layout.fragment_hide_show.xml
        .layout.labeled_text_edit.xml
            Demonstration of hiding and showing fragments while keeping fragment state
            using FragmentTransaction.hide(Fragment), and FragmentTransaction.show(Fragment).
            The Fragment's used to be created in the layout using the <fragment> xml element,
            which works when using the Activity class, but with the AppCompatActivity or the
            FragmentActivity class you need to use a FragmentTransaction to add the fragments
            the first time the app is run if you want to hide/show them, otherwise we get a null
            pointer exception when you try to find them using the FragmentManager for some
            reason, but the android docs do mention a problem, see:
            https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/creating
            Where it says:
            Note: When you add a fragment to an activity layout by defining the fragment in the
            layout XML file, you cannot remove the fragment at runtime. If you plan to swap your
            fragments in and out during user interaction, you must add the fragment to the activity
            when the activity first starts, as shown in Build a flexible UI.

    App/Fragment/Layout                    v11
        .app.FragmentLayout                CRASHES both Xcite and Nexus 7 (fixed)
        .layout-land/fragment_layout.xml
        .layout/fragment_layout.xml
            Demonstration of using fragments to implement different activity layouts.
            This sample provides a different layout (and activity flow) when run in
            landscape. It crashes as is in landscape mode because of a reference to the
            non-existent containerViewId R.id.a_item in the call at line 156: 
                  (FragmentTransaction) ft.replace(R.id.a_item, details)
            This was obviously added by a runaway modification script, and the container
            id should be R.id.details

    App/Fragment/List Array                v11
        .app.FragmentListArray
            Uses a ListFragment as the sole content of the activities window, using setListAdapter to
            configure the list to display an array by constructing an ArrayAdapter<String> using that
            array (Shakespeare.TITLES) as its data:

            ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(), android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, Shakespeare.TITLES));

            It overrides onListItemClick simply to log the id of the item clicked.

    App/Fragment/Menu                      v11
        .app.FragmentMenu
        .layout.fragment_menu.xml
            Builds menus from two fragments, allowing you to hide them to remove them.

    App/Fragment/Nesting Tabs              v17
        .app.FragmentNestingTabs
        .layout.fragment_tabs_fragment.xml
            Uses tabs in the ActionBar to select between other activities in App/Fragment:
            FragmentMenuFragment.java, FragmentArgumentsFragment.java, FragmentStackFragment.java,
            FragmentTabsFragment.java. Uses FragmentManager.enableDebugLogging(true) to produce
            debugging info from the FragmentManager (very useful)

    App/Fragment/Receive Result            v11
        .app.FragmentReceiveResult
        .app.SendResult
        .layout.receive_result.xml
            FragmentReceiveResult builds a FrameLayout in java -- no xml layout. To this it adds
            the Fragment ReceiveResultFragment which uses the layout R.layout.receive_result. Then
            it starts the activity SendResult (startActivityForResult) which returns the
            users input in an intent setResult(RESULT_OK, (new Intent()).setAction("Corky!"))
            which FragmentReceiveResult receives in the callback onActivityResult and then
            appends it to the Editable TextView id R.id.results contained in the layout
            R.layout.receive_result.

    App/Fragment/Retain Instance           v11
        .app.FragmentRetainInstance
        .layout.fragment_retain_instance.xml
            Work fragment/thread calls setRetainInstance(true) in its onCreate callback, 
            causing it and the thread it is running to be retained when the device configuration
            changes. Shows how you can use a Fragment to easily propagate state (such as 
            threads) across activity instances when an activity needs to be restarted. This is
            a lot easier than using the raw Activity.onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() API.

    App/Fragment/Stack                     v11 -> crashes less than v16
        .app.FragmentStack
        .layout.fragment_stack.xml
        .layout.hello_world.xml
            Shows how to push and pop fragments using the system backstack. 
            FragmentTransaction.addToBackStack() adds the fragement to the backstack, and
            getFragmentManager().popBackStack() (or simply pressing "back" button) goes back
            one fragment, using a fancy animation for push and pop. (Not really visible on
            Nexus 6 Marshmallow, but striking on Excite 10.)

    App/Fragment/Tabs                      v11 -> v13 because of .detach
        .app.FragmentTabs *** TODO: Revise to non-deprecated API
        .app.FragmentStack
        .app.LoaderCursor
        .app.LoaderCustom
        .app.LoaderThrottle
            This demonstrates the use of action bar tabs and how they interact with other
            action bar features. The Activities chosen to populate the tabs all have 
            their own uses for the action bar, and they are switched in and out by a 
            class which implements ActionBar.TabListener (TabListener<T extends Fragment>)

  Job
    App/Job/Job Work Service Controller   v26
        .app.JobWorkServiceActivity
        .layout.job_work_service_activity.xml

  Loader
    App/Loader/Cursor                      v11
        .app.LoaderCursor
            Creates a custom class CursorLoaderListFragment which extends ListFragment, 
            with the necessary callbacks to serve as a CursorLoader to load and display 
            contacts data in the ListFragment. Includes the use of a SearchView which
            might come in handy for MarkovChain

    App/Loader/Custom                      v11 -> v14
        .app.LoaderCustom
            Shows how to implement a custom AsyncTaskLoader, it uses the system function
            PackageManager.getInstalledApplications to retrieve a List<ApplicationInfo> 
            containing the AndroidManifest information for all the installed apps.

    App/Loader/Retained                    v11 -> v14
        .app.LoaderRetained
            Demonstration of the use of a CursorLoader to load and display contacts
            data in a fragment. Shows how to retain a ListFragment by calling
            setRetainInstance(true) in the onActivityCreated callback.

    App/Loader/Throttle                    v11
        .app.LoaderThrottle
            Demonstration of bottom to top implementation of a content provider holding
            structured data through displaying it in the UI, using throttling to reduce
            the number of queries done when its data changes. Implements a custom CursorLoader
            which pretends to be a SQLite database, and simulates a slow provider of data
            LoaderThrottle$SimpleProvider

  Menu

            R.menu.title_icon, R.menu.submenu, R.menu.groups, R.menu.checkable, 
            R.menu.shortcuts, R.menu.order, R.menu.category_order, R.menu.visible, 
            and R.menu.disabled and use MenuInflater.inflate to inflate them.
            R.menu.title_icon does not show the icon (boo hoo!), but oddly enough
            the submenu does?

  Notification
    App/Notification/Background Service    v26
        .app.NotificationBackgroundService
        .layout.notification_background_service.xml
            Example service that gets launched from a notification and runs in the background. The
            nested class `Controller` of `NotificationBackgroundService` is the `AppCompatActivity`
            which is run when the user starts the demo.

    App/Notification/IncomingMessage       all -> v26
        .app.IncomingMessage               interstitial crashes froyo startActivities()

        .layout.incoming_message_view.xml
            Allows you to choose between a regular app notification, and an interstitial
            notification and shows how to launch IncomingMessageView from either type of
            notification. The interstitial choice launches IncomingMessageInterstitial 
            which on clicking the "Switch to App" button uses the same function as the 
            non-interstitial notification to launch IncomingMessageView.

    App/Notification/Notifying Service Controller  -- all -> v26
        .app.NotifyingController controls:
        .app.NotifyingService
        .layout.notifying_controller.xml
            Updates a notification every 5 seconds from a background thread. Note use of
            ConditionVariable to implement the condition variable locking paradigm, blocking
            for 5*1000 milliseconds after every notification (very useful approach).


    App/Notification/NotifyWithText        all
        .app.NotifyWithText
        .layout.notify_with_text.xml
            Show notification in a Toast.

        .app.PrintBitmap
        .layout.print_bitmap.xml
        .menu.print_custom_content.xml
            Shows how to print a Bitmap. Uses ImageView.getDrawable()).getBitmap(); to
            retrieve a bitmap of the drawable used in the screen, then to print it uses:
            PrintHelper.printBitmap("Print Bitmap", bitmap);

    App/Print/Print Custom Layout          v19
        .app.PrintCustomContent
        .menu.print_custom_content.xml
            Nifty example of a ListActivity with a custom ListAdapter, but it also shows
            how to allow the user to specify options for the printout, and then re-layout
            the pdf canvas View to reflect those changes when it comes time to print.

    App/Print/Print HTML from screen       v21
        .app.PrintHtmlFromScreen
        .layout.print_html_from_screen.xml
        .menu.print_custom_content.xml
            Uses a WebView as the View for the app, which allows it to use 
            WebView.createPrintDocumentAdapter() to print using PrintManager.print()

    App/Print/Print HTML off screen        v21
        .app.PrintHtmlOffScreen
        .layout.print_html_off_screen.xml
        .menu.print_custom_content.xml
            This activity shows a text prompt and when the user chooses the print option
            from the overflow menu an HTML page with content that is not on the screen
            is printed via an off-screen WebView.

  Search
    App/Search/Invoke Search               all
        .app.SearchInvoke
        .layout.search_invoke.xml
        .app.SearchQueryResults
        .app.SearchSuggestionSampleProvider (A provider specified in AndroidManifest.xml)
            This activity shows a few different ways to invoke search, and inserts context-specific
            data for use by the search activity The search activity  is defined in AndroidManifest.xml
            using a meta-data element added to our activity parent component which has the attributes:
            android:name="android.app.default_searchable" and android:value=".app.SearchQueryResults"
            This specifies .app.SearchQueryResults to be our searchable activity (it performs searches).
            The definition of android.app.default_searchable is more typically handled at the
            applications level, where it can serve as a default for all of your activities.


    App/Search/Query Search Results        all
        .app.SearchQueryResults
        .layout.search_query_results.xml
            This activity accepts query strings via the ACTION_SEARCH intent.  In a 
            full implementation, you would use the query string to select results from
            your data source, and present a list of those results to the user. Does not
            actually do anything unless the device has a "Search Key" like Froyo does.
            Note: that although this is intended to only be called by SearchInvoke it also can be
            launched using the "App/Search/Query Search Results" path of the ApiDemos app.

  Service
    App/Service/Foreground Service Controller  -- all -> v26
        .app.ForegroundServiceController
        .layout.foreground_service_controller.xml
        .app.ForegroundService

    App/Service/Local Service Binding          -- all
        .app.LocalServiceActivities$Binding
        .layout.local_service_binding.xml
        .app.LocalService
            This demonstrates the implementation of a service that runs in the same 
            process as the rest of the application, which is explicitly started and 
            stopped as desired. Binds to app.LocalService.java

    App/Service/Local Service Controller       -- all
        .app.LocalServiceActivities$Controller
        .layout.local_service_controller.xml

        .app.MessengerService --> service we bind to
            This is an example of implementing an application service that uses the
            Messenger class for communicating with clients.  This allows for remote
            interaction with a service, without needing to define an AIDL interface.

    App/Service/Remote Service Binding         -- all -> v26
        .app.RemoteService$Binding
        .layout.remote_service_binding.xml
        Uses the aidl files  IRemoteService.aidl, IRemoteServiceCallback.aidl and ISecondary.aidl
            This is an example of implementing an application service that runs in a 
            different process than the application. Because it can be in another
            process, we must use IPC to interact with it. The Controller, Binding and
            BindingOptions classes show how to interact with the service.

    App/Service/Remote Service Binding Options -- all -> v26

  Provider
    Content/Provider/Changed Contacts      all -- but LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>
    .content.ChangedContacts               requires v11, and some fields require v18
            Shows how to access the contacts database and list those that have changed or been
            deleted since a certain time. Layout is created by java code, includes instructive
            use of a ListView to contain the results of the Cursor queries.

    Content/Provider/Media Content Observer v24
    .content.MediaContentObserver
    .layout.media_content_observer.xml
    .content.MediaContentJob
    .content.PhotosContentJob
            Shows how to use a JobService and TriggerContentUri to monitor when there is a 
            change detected by the media provider.

    Content/Provider/Pick Contact          all
        .content.PickContact
        .layout.pick_contact.xml
            Demonstrates launching the contacts app to pick a contact.  Does not require
            permission to read contacts, as that permission will be granted when the 
            selected contact is returned.

    Content/Provider/Share Content         v16 required for setClipData v11 for newUri
        .content.ShareContent
        .layout.share_content.xml
        .content.FileProvider
            Demonstrates the share content api, uses the <provider> ".content.FileProvider" to
            pipe the image/jpeg to the app that the user selects to handle it.

  Resources
    Content/Resources/Layout Reference     all
        .content.ResourcesLayoutReference
        .layout.resources_layout_reference.xml
        .layout.resources_layout_reference_tablet.xml
        .values-xlarge.layout.xml
        .values-sw600dp.layout.xml
            Shows how to write layout resource references in values-* directories,
            so that you can define multiple different configurations of a layout
            resource that refer to one actual XML definition. References are defined
            in layout.xml files contained in res/values-xlarge and res/values-sw600dp
            which point to @layout/resources_layout_reference_tablet and
            @layout/resources_layout_reference_tablet respectively (uh... both same
            file?) There is also a default resources_layout_reference.xml file in
            res/layout/ which is used for other size screens.

    Content/Resources/Resources            all
        .content.ResourcesSample
        .layout.resources.xml
            Shows how to fetch R.string.styled_text from values*/strings.xml as styled
            text using Context.getText (int resId), as a string stripped of its style
            using Context.getString(int resId), and as styled text again using this 
            time Resources.getText (int id). The styled text uses html markup <b>, <i>,
            and <b><i> surrounding the text to set the style used

    Content/Resources/Smallest Width       v13
        .content.ResourcesSmallestWidth
        .layout.resources_smallest_width.xml

        .layout-sw480dp.resources_smallest_width_row.xml
        .layout-sw600dp.resources_smallest_width_row.xml
        .layout-sw720dp.resources_smallest_width_row.xml
            Layout file <includes \> layouts from layout, and layout-sw***/ in order to create custom
            FrameLayout area for different smallest width (sw480dp, sw600dp, and sw720dp). These in
            turn <include\> other FrameLayout's also with different versions for the smallest width
            (cute - huh?)

    Content/Resources/<i>Styled</i> <b>Text</b>  -- all
        .content.StyledText
        .layout.styled_text.xml
            Shows a resource string being used directly in the layout, and by being 
            retrieved and assigned programmatically.

    Content/Resources/Width and Height     v13
        .content.ResourcesWidthAndHeight
        .layout.resources_width_and_height.xml

        .layout-h670dp.resources_height.xml
        .layout-h974dp.resources_height.xml
            The layouts included by the {@code FrameLayout} inside R.layout.resources_width_and_height
            use layout-wNNNdp and layout-hNNNdp to select between different versions based on the size
            of the screen. Those from layout-hNNNdp are included first using @layout/resources_height
            and these different layouts in turn include layouts from layout-hNNNdp by asking for
            @layout/resources_width.

  Storage
   Documents
    Content/Storage/Documents              v21
        .content.DocumentsSample
            Exercises the client side of the DocumentsContract api. Layout is created
            programmatically.

   External Storage
    Content/Storage/External Storage       all
        .content.ExternalStorage
        .layout.external_storage.xml
        .layout.external_storage_item.xml
            Shows how to use the external storage directory api for both public and 
            app private directories. Note: as of Android Q the public storage is no
            longer usable without android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true", so it
            is best to switch public storage use to the Content/Storage/Documents aka
            DocumentsContract api above.

  Undo
    Content/Undo                           android:allowUndo="false" requires v23 ("m")
        .content.TextUndoActivity
        .layout.text_undo.xml
            Simple example of using an UndoManager for editing text in a TextView. (Or so it says)
            Actually an example of using InputFilter.LengthFilter to limit the length of text entered,
            a DigitsKeyListener, and a TextWatcher.

Graphics
  AlphaBitmap
    Graphics/AlphaBitmap                   all
        .graphics.AlphaBitmap
            Shows how to use alpha channel compositing in 2D graphics using PorterDuffXfermode
            and Bitmap.extractAlpha -- also shows how to create your own View in code alone.
            See: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PorterDuff.Mode.html
            for details of the graphic algebra performed with the different PorterDuff modes
            You can use the key below to understand the algebra that the Android docs use to
            describe the other modes (see the article for a fuller description with similar terms).

                Sa Source alpha
                Sc Source color
                Da Destination alpha
                Dc Destination color

            Where alpha is a value [0..1], and color is substituted once per channel (so use
            the formula once for each of red, green and blue)

            The resulting values are specified as a pair in square braces as follows.

            [<alpha-value>,<color-value>]

            Where alpha-value and color-value are formulas for generating the resulting
            alpha chanel and each color chanel respectively.
            TODO: Exercise all the other PorterDuff modes.

  AnimateDrawables
    Graphics/AnimateDrawables              all
        .graphics.AnimateDrawables
        .graphics.AnimateDrawable
        .graphics.ProxyDrawable
            Shows how to use the Animation api (in this case TranslateAnimation) in order 
            to move a jpg around a Canvas. Uses AnimateDrawable which extends ProxyDrawable
            (A neat way to package the methods required when extending Drawable, overriding
            only draw in AnimateDrawable)

  Arcs
    Graphics/Arcs                          all
        .graphics.Arcs
            Shows how to draw arcs and rectangles to a Canvas -- need to figure out what
            slows down frame rate -- I'm guessing something inside native_drawArc

  BitmapDecode
    Graphics/BitmapDecode               all crashes LG-8.3, works: froyo, Nexus 7. Nexus 4, Nexus 9
        .graphics.BitmapDecode             Crash in android.graphics.Movie.java native method draw
            line 40. Shows how to decode various image file formats into displayable bitmaps:
            drawable/beach.jpg, drawable/frog.gif (creates also an Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888 bitmap,
            and a Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444 bitmap from that bitmap), drawable/button.9.png, and
            drawable/animated_gif.gif which it animates using android.graphics.Movie.java
            TODO: replace Movie with android.graphics.drawable.AnimatedImageDrawable

  BitmapMesh
    Graphics/BitmapMesh                    all
        .graphics.BitmapMesh
            Uses android.graphics.Canvas method drawBitmapMesh to warp a bitmap near the 
            area it is touched. Very subtle effect on Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P -> Marshmallow
            or just small high density screen?

  BitmapPixels
    Graphics/BitmapPixels                  all crashes lollipop, works froyo, jellybean
        .graphics.BitmapPixels
            Supposed to show Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888, Bitmap.Config.RGB_565, and Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444
            configurations of the same color ramp, but ever since KitKat Bitmap.createBitmap will return 
            a Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888 bitmap instead of Bitmap.Config.ARGB_4444 bitmap, so the call to
            mBitmap3.copyPixelsFromBuffer(makeBuffer(data4444, N)); on line 147 will crash Lollipop.
            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) kludge to make it work on newer
            versions. TODO: make kludge use ARGB_8888 instead?

  CameraPreview
    Graphics/CameraPreview                 all crashes froyo -- getNumberOfCameras() needs v9+
        .graphics.CameraPreview
            Shows how to create a SurfaceView for the deprecated Camera api (use android.hardware.camera2)

  Clipping
    Graphics/Clipping                      all
        .graphics.Clipping
            Shows how to use android.graphics.Canvas methods clipPath and clipRect, as well as
            some other Canvas drawing methods.

  ColorFilters
    Graphics/ColorFilters                  all
        .graphics.ColorFilters
            Applies a PorterDuffColorFilter to tint some button like drawables using several
            different colors, and both PorterDuff.Mode.SRC_ATOP, and PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY
            PorterDuff modes to apply them. Oddly only froyo spaces the drawables properly 
            probably due to the use of drawable-mdpi and drawable-hdpi versions. Checking
            Drawable.getIntrinsicHeight() and modifying the spacing for hdpi fixes the problem.

  ColorMatrix
    Graphics/ColorMatrix                   all
        .graphics.ColorMatrixSample
            Uses ColorMatrixColorFilter's to create three different versions of a jpeg, 
            animating them through different "contrasts". One changes both scale and 
            translate, one changes scale only, and one changes translate only. (The original
            is at top of left column, scale and translate to right of it, scale only second row,
            and translate only is in the third row.)

  Compass
    Graphics/Compass                       all
        .graphics.Compass
            Displays a compass pointer which it rotates according to SensorEvent it receives
            in its override of the onSensorChanged method. The rotation is done using the
            matrix pre-concatenated by Canvas.rotate(float degrees) 

  CreateBitmap
    Graphics/CreateBitmap                  all
        .graphics.CreateBitmap
            Shows how to create bitmaps programmatically, how to compress them to JPG and PNG
            formats, and shows how JPG looses information while PNG is loss-less.

  Density
    Graphics/Density                       all
        .graphics.DensityActivity
        .layout.density_image_views.xml
            This activity demonstrates various ways density can cause the scaling of bitmaps
            and drawables. Includes sample code for different ways to get drawables onto the
            different dpi screens.

  Drawable
    Graphics/Drawable/GradientDrawable     all
        .graphics.GradientDrawable1
            Uses xml to draw <shape> ImageView(s). shape_5.xml has a <gradient>

    Graphics/Drawable/ShapeDrawable        all
        .graphics.ShapeDrawable1
            Drawing using the Drawable class methods, many of them usable in <shape> xml drawables.

  FingerPaint
    Graphics/FingerPaint                   all
        .graphics.FingerPaint
        .graphics.ColorPickerDialog
            Shows off some Canvas drawing methods and View.onTouchEvent usage.

  Layers
    Graphics/Layers                        all
        .graphics.Layers
            Shows the use of Canvas.saveLayerAlpha() and Canvas.restore() to save and restore
            Canvas settings while doing some drawing in an off screen buffer.

  MeasureText
    Graphics/MeasureText                   all
        .graphics.MeasureText
            Shows how to use the text measurement methods: Paint.getTextWidths(), 
            Paint.measureText(), and Paint.getTextBounds() to determine what area
            each character in a string as well as the complete string will occupy 
            when they are drawn using Canvas.drawText, then draws a colored rectangle
            around each string and a line under each at the baseline. Text was too
            small so I modified it a bit.

  OpenGL ES
   Compressed Texture
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Compressed Texture  all
        .graphics.CompressedTextureActivity
        .graphics.StaticTriangleRenderer
            Demonstrate how to use ETC1 format compressed textures. This sample can be
            recompiled to use either resource-based textures (compressed offline using
            the etc1tool), or textures created on the fly by compressing images.

   Cube Map
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Cube Map            all
        .graphics.CubeMapActivity
            Demonstrate how to use the OES_texture_cube_map extension, available on some
            high-end OpenGL ES 1.x GPUs. Shows how to load and use GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP
            textures to animate a gyrating Torus.

   Frame Buffer Object
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Frame Buffer Object all
        .graphics.FrameBufferObjectActivity
        .graphics.Triangle
        .graphics.Cube
            Demonstrate the Frame Buffer Object OpenGL ES extension. This sample renders
            a scene into an offscreen frame buffer, and then uses the resulting image as
            a texture to render an onscreen scene.

   GLSurfaceView
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/GLSurfaceView       all
        .graphics.GLSurfaceViewActivity
        .graphics.CubeRenderer
        .graphics.Cube
            Wrapper activity demonstrating the use of GLSurfaceView, a view that uses OpenGL
            drawing into a dedicated surface. Uses CubeRenderer to render a pair of tumbling
            cubes created and draw(n) by Cube.java

   Kube
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Kube                all

        .graphics.kube.Layer
        .graphics.kube.M4
            Animates a Rubic cube, randomly spinning layers one by one.

   Matrix Palette Skinning
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Matrix Palette Skinning  -- all
        .graphics.MatrixPaletteActivity
        .graphics.MatrixPaletteRenderer
            This sample shows how to implement a Matrix Palette, used to rock a column
            back and forth.

   OpenGL ES 2.0
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/OpenGL ES 2.0       all
        .graphics.GLES20Activity
        .graphics.GLES20TriangleRenderer
        .graphics.TriangleRenderer
            This sample shows how to check for OpenGL ES 2.0 support at runtime, and then
            use either OpenGL ES 1.0 or OpenGL ES 2.0, as appropriate. Since even froyo 
            uses 2.0 this is not all that important it seems. Does show a simple example
            of using Vertex shaders, and Fragment shaders (Pixel shaders).

   Sprite Text
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Sprite Text         all
        .graphics.spritetext.SpriteTextActivity
        .graphics.spritetext.LabelMaker
        .graphics.spritetext.MatrixGrabber
        .graphics.spritetext.MatrixStack
        .graphics.spritetext.MatrixTrackingGL
        .graphics.spritetext.NumericSprite
        .graphics.spritetext.Projector
        .graphics.spritetext.SpriteTextRenderer
            Shows how to add text to a GLSurfaceView using OpenGL labels. OpenGL labels 
            are implemented by creating a Bitmap, drawing all the labels into the Bitmap,
            converting the Bitmap into an Alpha texture, and drawing portions of the
            texture using glDrawTexiOES. The benefits of this approach are that the 
            labels are drawn using the high quality anti-aliased font rasterizer, full
            character set support, and all the text labels are stored on a single texture, 
            which makes it faster to use. The drawbacks are that you can only have as many
            labels as will fit onto one texture, and you have to recreate the whole 
            texture if any label text changes. Characters are too small on lollipop, okay
            on froyo. TODO: Resize characters

   Textured Triangle
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Textured Triangle   all
        .graphics.TriangleActivity
        .graphics.StaticTriangleRenderer
            Shows a rotating triangle using a bitmap made from raw/robot.png as the 
            texture. It uses a GLSurfaceView.Renderer that uses the Android-specific 
            android.opengl.GLESXXX static OpenGL ES APIs. The static APIs expose more 
            of the OpenGL ES features than the javax.microedition.khronos.opengles APIs,
            and also provide a programming model that is closer to the C OpenGL ES APIs, 
            which may make it easier to reuse code and documentation written for the C 
            OpenGL ES APIs. It uses android:theme="@style/ThemeCurrentDialog" in the
            AndroidManifest.xml so the SurfaceView is shrunk to appear in a dialog size
            window TODO: Appears to be very broken on Pixel 2 XL - find out why.

   Touch Rotate
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Touch Rotate        v26
        .graphics.TouchRotateActivity
        .graphics.Cube
            Shows how to redraw in response to user input. Draws a cube, and allows the
            user to rotate it using their finger.

   Translucent GLSurfaceView
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Translucent GLSurfaceView  -- all
        .graphics.TranslucentGLSurfaceViewActivity
        .graphics.CubeRenderer
            Sets the background of the GLSurfaceView of a CubeRenderer to Translucent, 
            allowing the user to see the ApiDemos application behind the rotating cube.

  PathEffects
    Graphics/PathEffects                   all
        .graphics.PathEffects
            Shows how to use the PathEffect classes to make animated dashed lines, and 
            smoothed, rounded lines.

  PathFillTypes
    Graphics/PathFillTypes                 all
        .graphics.PathFillTypes
            Shows the effect of four different Path.FillType's on the same Path, which
            consists of two intersecting circles: 
            Path.FillType.WINDING, Path.FillType.EVEN_ODD, Path.FillType.INVERSE_WINDING, 
            and Path.FillType.INVERSE_EVEN_ODD.
            TODO: See convertDpToPixel for example of converting pixels to dp and apply elsewhere

  Patterns
    Graphics/Patterns                      all
        .graphics.Patterns
            Creates two Bitmap's: a blue rectangle on a red background, and a green 
            circle on a clear background. It uses these Bitmap's to make two 
            BitmapShader's, and it rotates the Circle BitmapShader by 30 degrees.
            In the onDraw method it first draws using the rectangle pattern, translate's
            the Canvas based on the current MotionEvent movement and draws using the
            circle pattern. The effect is to allow you to move the circle pattern with
            your finger while leaving the rectangle pattern stationary and partially visible

            calling Picture.endRecording() the Picture  is turned into a Drawable by
            calling PictureDrawable(Picture). Then in the onDraw method it first draws
            the Picture using the Canvas.drawPicture(Picture) method then it stretches
            the Picture when drawing using the Canvas.drawPicture(Picture,RectF) method,
            then it draws the Drawable it created with PictureDrawable(Picture) to draw
            using Drawable.draw(Canvas).
            Prior to API 29 then it wrote the Picture to a ByteArrayOutputStream and drew
            it by reading that ByteArrayOutputStream back in and then drew it using
            Canvas.drawPicture(Picture.createFromStream(is)), but API 29 removed both

            This should be called early, typically when the application is first created. An easy way

            show the item's picture. When the user clicks the picture, it flips to show 
            the list. The animation is made of two smaller animations: the first half 
            rotates the list by 90 degrees on the Y axis and the second half rotates the
            picture by 90 degrees on the Y axis. When the first half finishes, the list

    Views/Custom                           all
        .view.CustomView1
        .view.LabelView
            Demonstrates creating a Screen that uses custom views. This example uses
            com.example.android.apis.view.LabelView.kt -- the attributes it accepts
            are defined in the file values/attrs.xml

  Date Widgets
    Views/Date Widgets/1. Dialog           all
        .view.DateWidgets1
        .layout.date_widgets_example_1.xml
            Basic example of using date and time widgets, including android.app.TimePickerDialog
            and android.widget.DatePicker. Also provides a good example of using Activity#onCreateDialog,
            Activity#onPrepareDialog and Activity#showDialog to have the activity automatically

  Expandable Lists
    Views/Expandable Lists/1. Custom Adapter  -- all -- v17+ or crash
        .view.ExpandableList1
        .layout.expandable_list1.xml
            Demonstrates expandable lists using a custom ExpandableListAdapter from
            BaseExpandableListAdapter. The custom BaseExpandableListAdapter groups
            different child lists under group names: "People Names", "Dog Names", 
            "Cat Names", and "Fish Names". When clicked the groups expand to show the
            child lists, any child or group which is long-pressed will pop up a context
            menu with an "action button".

    Views/Expandable Lists/2. Cursor (People) -- all -- crashes on froyo: null pointer
        .view.ExpandableList2
            Demonstrates expandable lists backed by Cursors -- uses Contacts data base to
            retrieve names and when a name is clicked expands to show the phone numbers 
            for that name.

    Views/Expandable Lists/3. Simple Adapter  -- all
        .view.ExpandableList3
            Demonstrates expandable lists backed by a Simple Map-based adapter, which is
            created using SimpleExpandableListAdapter

  Focus
    Views/Focus/1. Vertical                all
        .view.Focus1
            Demonstrates the use of non-focusable views: caused by android:focusable="false" 
            in layout file layout/focus_1.xml

    Views/Focus/2. Horizontal              all
        .view.Focus2
            Uses android:nextFocusRight="@+id/rightButton" to skip middle button -- need
            input device suitable for changing focus.

    Views/Focus/3. Circular                all
        .view.Focus3
            Uses android:nextFocusDown="@+id/bottom", android:nextFocusLeft="@+id/left",
            android:nextFocusUp="@+id/top", and android:nextFocusRight="@+id/right" to
            specify focus behavior that would be difficult with default focus calculation 
            algorithm -- need input device suitable for changing focus.

    Views/Focus/4. Internal Selection      all
        .view.InternalSelectionFocus
        .view.InternalSelectionView
            android.view.View#requestFocus(int, android.graphics.Rect) and 
            android.view.View#onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)
            work together to give a newly focused item a hint about the most interesting
            rectangle of the previously focused view.  The view taking focus can use this
            to set an internal selection more appropriate using this rect.
            This Activity exercises that behavior using three adjacent InternalSelectionView
            that report interesting rects when giving up focus, and use interesting rects
            when taking focus to best select the internal row to show as selected.
            Were InternalSelectionView not to override android.view.View#getFocusedRect, or
            android.view.View#onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)}, the focus 
            would jump to some default internal selection (the top) and not allow for the 
            smooth hand-off. Need keys to move focus, so I do not know what this does.

    Views/Focus/5. Sequential (Tab Order)  all
        .view.Focus5
            Demonstrates using nextFocusForward in the layout/focus_5.xml to explicitly 
            set sequential focus order. Not for touch only.

    Views/Focus/6. Window Focus Observer   all  -- v18+ or crash
        .view.WindowFocusObserver
            Implements a WindowId.FocusObserver() whose onFocusGained(WindowId) merely
            prints "Gained focus", and whose onFocusLost(WindowId) prints "Lost focus".
             When menu items are clicked or the app is put in the background the window
             loses focus even on a touch only device.

  Game Controller Input
    Views/Game Controller Input            all
        .view.GameControllerInput
        .view.GameView
        .layout.game_controller_input.xml
            Demonstrates how to process input events received from game controllers.
            It also shows how to detect when input devices are added, removed or 
            reconfigured.
            This activity displays button states and joystick positions. Also writes 
            detailed information about relevant input events to the log. The game 
            controller is also uses to control a very simple game.  See GameView
            for the game itself, it is used by our layout file R.layout.game_controller_input.
            No game controller here.

  Grid
    Views/Grid/1. Icon Grid                all
        .view.Grid1
        .layout.grid_1.xml
            Shows how to use a GridView to display a grid of ImageView's created from
            the app icons retrieved from the PackageManager

    Views/Grid/2. Photo Grid               all
        .view.Grid2
        .layout.grid_2.xml
            Shows how to use a GridView created from resource jpg's using 
            ImageView.setImageResource

    Views/Grid/3. Selection Mode           all -- v11+ or crash
        .view.Grid3
        .layout.grid_1.xml

        .view.Hover
        .view.HoverInterceptorView
        .layout.hover.xml
            No idea what this is supposed to do -- need mouse.

  ImageButton
    Views/ImageButton                      all
        .view.ImageButton1
        .layout.image_button_1.xml
            Simply shows how to draw images on buttons using the SDK stock image.

  ImageView
    Views/ImageView                        all
        .view.ImageView1
        .layout.image_view_1.xml
            Shows how to control scaling in an ImageView in a layout file using:
            android:layout_width, android:layout_height, android:maxWidth, and 
            android:maxHeight and other attributes of ImageView.

  Input Method
    Views/Input Method/HintLocales         v24
         .inputmethod.HintLocales
             Provide some EditText with specifying android.view.inputmethod.EditorInfo.hintLocales
             so that IME developers can test their IMEs.

    Views/Input Method/ShowInputMethodAndSubtypeEnabler  v24
         .inputmethod.ShowInputMethodAndSubtypeEnabler
             Demonstrates how to show the input method subtype enabler without relying on
             InputMethodManager.showInputMethodAndSubtypeEnabler(String), which is highly 
             likely to be broken.

  Layout Animation
    Views/Layout Animation/1. Grid Fade    all
        .view.LayoutAnimation1
        .layout.layout_animation_1.xml
            Uses @anim/layout_grid_fade.xml which is a gridLayoutAnimation which uses
            @anim/fade.xml to fade in app icons in a GridView

    Views/Layout Animation/2. List Cascade all
        .view.LayoutAnimation2
        .layout.layout_animation_2.xml
            Shows how to use a LayoutAnimationController to animate the layout of a list

        .view.LayoutAnimation3
        .layout.layout_animation_3.xml
            Same as List Cascade above, but an android:layoutAnimation attribute in the layout
            file R.layout.layout_animation_3 uses anim/layout_bottom_to_top_slide.xml which uses
             anim/slide_right instead of implementing the animation in code

    Views/Layout Animation/4. Randomize    all
        .view.LayoutAnimation4
        .layout.layout_animation_4.xml
            Its layout file R.layout.layout_animation_4 uses a android:layoutAnimation attribute
            to animate using anim/layout_random_fade which has an android:animationOrder="random"
            attribute and uses the alpha animation specified in anim/fade.xml to fade in app
            icons in random order.

    Views/Layout Animation/5. Grid Direction  -- all
        .view.LayoutAnimation5
        .layout.layout_animation_5.xml
            Its layout file R.layout.layout_animation_5 uses an android:layoutAnimation attribute
            which uses "@anim/layout_grid_inverse_fade" which in turn uses the attributes
            android:directionPriority="row", and android:direction="right_to_left|bottom_to_top"
            along with anim/fade.xml to fade in app icons in a grid from bottom right to top left
            instead of top down order.

    Views/Layout Animation/6. Wave Scale   all
        .view.LayoutAnimation6
        .layout.layout_animation_6.xml
            Its layout file R.layout.layout_animation_6 uses an android:layoutAnimation attribute
            specifying "@anim/layout_wave_scale" as the animation, which in turn uses an
            android:animation attribute to specify @anim/wave_scale as its animation. This
            animation animates alpha from 0.0 to 1.0 with a duration of 100, and two fancy scaling
            animations. The results are: 1. Fade in app icons, 2. Scale them in from .5 size, to
            1.5 size, 3. Scale back from 1.5 to 1.0 size.

    Views/Layout Animation/7. Nested Animations  -- all
        .view.LayoutAnimation7
            Its layout file R.layout.layout_animation_7 contains an android:layoutAnimation
            attribute specifying @anim/layout_animation_table as its animation. This creates
            an animation of the layout files TableLayout, with the layout of each TableRow
            animated using an android:layoutAnimation so that alternating rows use
            @anim/layout_animation_row_right_slide and @anim/layout_animation_row_left_slide.
            Way too fast to see effect well even on Excite 10

  Layouts
  Baseline
    Views/Layouts/Baseline/1. Top          all
        .view.Baseline1
            Use default android:layout_gravity of LinearLayout to place widgets at top 
            of window -- the baseline of the text in the views of differently sized text
            is used to align.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/2. Bottom       all
        .view.Baseline2
            Uses android:layout_gravity="bottom" of LinearLayout to place widgets at 
            bottom of window -- the baseline of the text in the views of differently sized
            text is used to align.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/3. Center       all
        .view.Baseline3
            This example shows that baseline alignment has no effect when the layout
            gravity is set to center_vertical.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/4. Everywhere   all
        .view.Baseline4
            This example scatters widgets around the window using different values of
            android:layout_gravity

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/5. Multi-line   all
        .view.Baseline6
            Demonstrates the baseline alignment in a RelativeLayout when one of the 
            widgets is a multi-line EditText

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/6. Relative     all
        .view.Baseline7
            Shows alignment in a RelativeLayout using android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
            and android:layout_alignParentRight="true" for two different TextView widgets.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 1  --all
        .view.BaselineNested1
            Shows how to use android:baselineAlignedChildIndex to align the baseline of
            widgets contained inside a android:orientation="horizontal" LinearLayout
            TODO: describe layout file R.layout.baseline_nested_1

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 2  --all
        .view.BaselineNested2
            More use of android:baselineAlignedChildIndex to align specific widget inside
            compound nested Views

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 3  --all
        .view.BaselineNested3
            Using android:baselineAlignedChildIndex again this time to point to a linear 
            layout to baseline align by, which in turn will point to a text view inside 
            of it.

  CustomLayout
    Views/Layouts/CustomLayout             all -- v11+ or crashes combineMeasuredStates
        .view.CustomLayoutActivity
        .view.CustomLayout
            Example of writing a custom layout manager.  This is a fairly full-featured 
            layout manager that is relatively general, handling all layout cases.  The
            custom parameters that it supports are extensions of ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams

  GridLayout
    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/1. Simple Form  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout1
        .layout.grid_layout_1
            Demonstrates using GridLayout to build the same "Simple Form" as in the
            LinearLayout and RelativeLayout demos.

    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/2. Form (XML)  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout2
            A form, showing use of the GridLayout API from XML, using a separate layout
            for landscape mode defined in layout-land

    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/3. Form (Java)  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout3
            A form, showing use of the GridLayout API from java code. Here we demonstrate
            use of the row/column order preserved property which allows rows and or
            columns to pass over each other when needed. The two buttons in the bottom right
            corner need to be separated from the other UI elements. This can either 
            be done by separating rows or separating columns - but we don't need to 
            do both and may only have enough space to do one or the other. Uses
            GridLayout.Spec spec(...) to specify the horizontal and/or vertical
            characteristics of the cells.

  HorizontalScrollView
    Views/Layouts/HorizontalScrollView    all
        .view.HorizontalScrollView1
        .layout.horizontal_scroll_view1
            Demonstrates horizontal scrolling with a HorizontalScrollView. Needed to set
            android:textSize to see properly.

  LinearLayout
    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/01. Vertical  --all
        .view.LinearLayout1
        .layout.linear_layout_1.xml
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The height of the layout is the sum of 
            its children due to android:layout_height="wrap_content"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/02. Vertical (Fill Screen)  --all
        .view.LinearLayout2
        .layout.linear_layout_2.xml
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the
            children stacked from the top due to android:layout_height="match_parent"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/03. Vertical (Padded)  --all
        .view.LinearLayout3
        .layout.linear_layout_3.xml
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the 
            children stacked from the top. The middle child gets allocated any extra 
            space due to android:layout_weight="1"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/04. Horizontal  --all
        .view.LinearLayout4
        .layout.linear_layout_4.xml
            Demonstrates a horizontal linear layout with equally sized columns due to
            all children View's using android:layout_weight="1"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/05. Simple Form  --all
        .view.LinearLayout5
        .layout.linear_layout_5.xml
            Demonstrates building a simple form with nested LinearLayouts. It uses
            a horizontal layout to hold the two buttons at the bottom and uses
            layout_gravity="right". This means the whole horizontal LinearLayout is
            right aligned, not the individual items within it. The horizontal
            LinearLayout's width is set to wrap_content. (If it was match_parent
            it would not have any room to slide to the right.)

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/06. Uniform Size  --all
        .view.LinearLayout6
        .layout.linear_layout_6.xml
            LinearLayout which uses a combination of wrap_content on itself and 
            match_parent on all of its children to get every item to be the same width.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/07. Fill Parent  --all
        .view.LinearLayout7
        .layout.linear_layout_7.xml
            Demonstrates a horizontal linear layout with equally sized columns. Some 
            columns force their height to match the parent. Does not work as is for some
            reason. Changed the height of the longest text to android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            and it works as advertised.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/08. Gravity  --all
        .view.LinearLayout8
        .layout.linear_layout_8.xml
            Demonstrates changing gravity of a LinearLayout programmatically using
            setOrientation(LinearLayout.*) as dictated by options menu choice.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/09. Layout Weight  --all
        .view.LinearLayout9
        .view.AutoComplete1
        .layout.linear_layout_9.xml
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the
            children stacked from the top. The ListView receives all the extra space due
            to android:layout_weight="1.0", but because it is still larger than the screen
            it is forced to enter scroll mode.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/10. Background Image  --all
        .view.LinearLayout10
        .layout.linear_layout_10.xml
            Demonstrates the use of LinearLayout backgrounds to group labels,
            EditTexts, and buttons, -- OR -- Demonstrates using a LinearLayout

   RelativeLayout
    Views/Layouts/RelativeLayout/1. Vertical  --all
        .view.RelativeLayout1
        .layout.relative_layout_1.xml
            A simple layout which demonstrates stretching a view to fill the space
            between two other views. This occurs oddly enough because even though all
            three share the same default weight, the android:layout_height="0dip"
            causes the center view to take the leftover space from the parent.

    Views/Layouts/RelativeLayout/2. Simple Form  --all
        .view.RelativeLayout2
        .layout.relative_layout_2.xml
            Demonstrates using a relative layout to create a form.

    ScrollView
    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/1. Short      all
        .view.ScrollView1
        .layout.scroll_view_1.xml
            Demonstrates wrapping a (short) layout in a ScrollView.

    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/2. Long       all
        .view.ScrollView2
        .layout.scroll_view_2.xml
            Demonstrates wrapping a LONG LinearLayout in a ScrollView (All but the first
            TextView and Button in the LinearLayout are Created and .addView'd programmatically)

    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/3. Internal Selection  --all
        .view.InternalSelectionScroll
        .view.InternalSelectionView
            Demonstrates how a well behaved view with internal selection InternalSelectionView
            can cause its parent android.widget.ScrollView to scroll to keep the internally
            interesting rectangle on the screen.  InternalSelectionView achieves this by calling
            android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen each time its internal selection changes.
            android.widget.ScrollView, in turn, implements android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen
            thereby acheiving the result.  Note that android.widget.ListView also implements the
            method, so views that call android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen that are embedded
            within either android.widget.ScrollView's or android.widget.ListView's can expect to
            keep their internal interesting rectangle visible.  Needs keyboard and a fix to
            background colors in InternalSelectView.java

    TableLayout
    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/01. Basic    all
        .view.TableLayout1
        .layout.table_layout_1.xml
            Very simple example of TableLayout done entirely in xml, three rows, three columns of
            TextViews

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/02. Empty Cells  --all
        .view.TableLayout2
        .layout.table_layout_2.xml
            TableLayout of Button and TextView's showing how to leave a cell empty

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/03. Long Content  --all
        .view.TableLayout3
        .layout.table_layout_3.xml
            Rows have different number of columns and content doesn't fit on screen:
            column 4 of row 2 shrinks all of the other columns android:shrinkColumns="2, 3"
            Oddly enough my test devices are too wide to need shrinking so it does not
            actually show what it intends to show. Not only that, but if the text is too long
            it is wrapped and the row is increased in size to fit the entire text.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/04. Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout4
        .layout.table_layout_4.xml

            android:stretchColumns="1" (column numbers are zero based)

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/05. Spanning and Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout5
        .layout.table_layout_5.xml

            TableRow's

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/06. More Spanning and Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout6
        .layout.table_layout_6.xml
            Uses android:stretchColumns="1" to stretch second column, and android:layout_column="1"
            to skip column 0 for some TableRow's

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/07. Column Collapse  --all
        .view.TableLayout7
        .layout.table_layout_7.xml
            Button's toggle collapsed state of column 0 or column 2, also show how to build a
            TableRow and add it to a TableLayout programmatically. Note that the attribute
            android:collapseColumns="2" starts column 2 in a collapsed state.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/09. Toggle Shrink  --all
        .view.TableLayout9
        .layout.table_layout_9.xml
            Button uses setColumnShrinkable to toggle the shrinkColumns attribute of a table which
            has a column so long it forces the last columns off the screen.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/10. Simple Form  --all
        .view.TableLayout10
        .layout.table_layout_10.xml
            Uses xml only to construct a form, too long of an entry in the EditText boxes does a
            weird thing -- it scrolls the buttons at the bottom off the screen!
            TODO: Scroll the EditText boxes instead.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/11. Gravity  --all
        .view.TableLayout11
        .layout.table_layout_11.xml
            Shows difference in layout for android:gravity="right",
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal" and
            android:layout_gravity="right|bottom" (large cell height is set by
            a "strut" of 68dp for the right|bottom example row.)

        .view.List1
        .view.Cheeses
        .layout.list_1.xml
            A list view example where the data for the list comes from an array of strings. It uses
            an `ArrayAdapter<String>` to fill a [ListView]'s list. It sets the isTextFilterEnabled`
            property of the [ListView] to `true` so that the list is filtered when the user types,
            but as there is no way for the keyboard to appear on a phone this nifty feature does not

            A list view example where the data comes from a custom ListAdapter, onListItemClick is
            overridden to "toggle" the view between two states: collapsed to a title, and expanded
            to a title and text for that title

            A list view example where the data comes from a cursor. Original used the "selected"
            item in list to display the details of an item at the bottom of the string by implementing
            OnItemSelectedListener, I modified to do the same when onListItemClick is called since

            A list view that demonstrates the use of setEmptyView. This example also uses a custom
            layout file that adds some extra buttons to the screen instead of using the ListActivity
            default layout.

            AbsListView#setOnScrollListener(AbsListView.OnScrollListener)
            AbsListView#setOnItemScrollListener(AbsListView.OnItemScrollListener)
            to display the first letter of the visible range of cheeses. Uses an
            Handler thread to remove the dialog displaying the letter after 3000ms
            using postDelayed(mRemoveWindow, 3000); where mRemoveWindow is a pointer

    Views/Lists/13. Slow Adapter           all
        .view.List13
        .layout.list_13.xml
            Demonstrates how a list can avoid expensive operations during scrolls or flings.
            In this case, we pretend that binding a view to its data is slow (even though it
            really isn't). When a scroll/fling is happening, the adapter binds the view to
            temporary data. After the scroll/fling has finished, the temporary data is
            replaced with the actual data. Usable approach but needs major modification to
            use in real world application.

    Views/Lists/14. Efficient Adapter      all
        .view.List14
        .view.Cheeses
            Demonstrates how to write an efficient list adapter. The adapter used in this example
            binds to an ImageView and to a TextView for each row in the list.
            To work efficiently the adapter implemented here uses two techniques:
            - It reuses the convertView passed to getView() to avoid inflating View
              when it is not necessary
            - It uses the ViewHolder pattern to avoid calling findViewById()
              when it is not necessary
            The ViewHolder pattern consists in storing a data structure in the tag of the view
            returned by getView(). This data structure contains references to the views we want
            to bind data to, thus avoiding calls to findViewById() every time getView() is invoked.
            Note: uses mInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_icon_text, parent, false) instead of
            mInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_icon_text, null)

            the default progress and android:secondaryProgress="75" to initialize the state
            of the secondary progress. Buttons below the ProgressBar decrement or increment

  Secure View
    Views/Secure View                      all -- v9+ or crash
        .view.SecureView
        .layout.secure_view.xml
        .view.SecureViewOverlay
            This activity demonstrates two different ways in which views can be made more secure to
            touch spoofing attacks by leveraging framework features.

            The activity presents 3 buttons that ostensibly perform a risky security critical
            function.  Under ordinary circumstances, the user would never click on these buttons
            or would at least think long and hard about it.  However, a carefully crafted toast can
            overlay the contents of the activity in such a way as to make the user believe the buttons
            are innocuous.  Since the toast cannot receive input, the touches are passed down to the
            activity potentially yielding an effect other than what the user intended.

            To simulate the spoofing risk, this activity pops up a specially crafted overlay as
            a toast lay-ed out so as to cover the buttons and part of the descriptive text.
            For the purposes of this demonstration, pretend that the overlay was actually popped
            up by a malicious application published by the International Cabal of Evil Penguins.

            The 3 buttons are set up as follows:

            1. The "unsecured button" does not apply any touch filtering of any kind.
               When the toast appears, this button remains clickable as usual which creates an
               opportunity for spoofing to occur.

            2. The "built-in secured button" leverages the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured view
               attribute to ask the framework to filter out touches when the window is obscured.
               When the toast appears, the button does not receive the touch and appears to be inoperable.

            3. The "custom secured button" adds a touch listener to the button which intercepts the
               touch event and checks whether the window is obscured.  If so, it warns the user and
               drops the touch event.  This example is intended to demonstrate how a view can
               perform its own filtering and provide additional feedback by examining the MotionEvent
               flags to determine whether the window is obscured.  Here we use a touch listener but
               a custom view subclass could perform the filtering by overriding
               View#onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent).

        .array.colors (in values/arrays.xml)
        .array.planets (in values/arrays.xml)
            Demonstrates the use of the Spinner widget. It creates two ArrayAdapter<CharSequence>
            from string-array resources and uses setDropDownViewResource to set the view used by the
            adapter to create drop down views, then uses setAdapter to set the adapter used by
            each Spinner. setOnItemSelectedListener is used to set an OnItemSelectedListener
            for each which involves implementing onItemSelected and onNothingSelected to receive
            callbacks when an item in the Spinner's is selected.

        .text.Link
        .layout.link.xml
            Four different ways to generate html like links and styled text: text1 shows
            the android:autoLink property, which automatically creates links for things
            like URLs and phone numbers found in the text. No java code is needed to make
            this work; text2 has links specified by putting <a> tags in the string resource.
            By default these links will appear but not respond to user input. To make
            them active, you need to call setMovementMethod() on the TextView object;
            text3 shows creating text with links from HTML in the Java code, rather than
            from a string resource.  Note that for a fixed string, using a (localizable)
            resource as shown above is usually a better way to go, this example is
            intended to illustrate how you might display text that came from a dynamic
            source (eg, the network); text4 illustrates constructing a styled string
            containing a link without using HTML at all.  Again, for a fixed string you
            should probably be using a string resource, not a hardcoded value.
