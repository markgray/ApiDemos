Animation (disabled for froyo)
  Animation/Activity Transition v20+
        .animation.ActivityTransition Becomes:
    Animation/Details of a specific thingy v20+
        .animation.ActivityTransitionDetails
            Uses ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation to transition using
            a shared view as the epicenter of the transition. The xml sets
            android:onClick="clicked" to use for each thumbnail in the GridLayout
            and clicked() creates an intent to launch ActivityTransitionDetails.class
            using a bundle containing an ActivityOptions.makeSceneTransitionAnimation()
            which causes the thumbnail to "expand" into the image detail version. When the
            ImageView in the image detail version is clicked, the reverse transition to
            ActivityTransition activity occurs. The animation is set up using AndroidManifest
            android:theme="@style/ActivityTransitionTheme" which contains elements which point
            to files in res/transition

  Animation/Bouncing Balls v11+
        .animation.BouncingBalls
            Uses several different kinds of ObjectAnimator to animate bouncing 
            color changing balls. When onTouchEvent is called with either a
            MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN or MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE a ball of random
            color is added at the events event.getX(), event.getY() coordinates.
            The ball motion and geometry is animated, then an animator of the balls
            alpha is played fading it out from an alpha of 1.0 to 0.0 in 250 milliseconds.
            The onAnimationEnd callback of the fade animation is set to an
            AnimatorListenerAdapter which removes the ball when the animation is done.
            The background color is also Animated. Note that setting the background color
            will automatically invalidate the view, so that the animated color, and the
            bouncing balls, get redisplayed on every frame of the background color animation.

  Animation/Cloning v11 
        .animation.AnimationCloning
            Creates an ObjectAnimator to animate the y position of an object from 0 to the
            bottom of the View, .clones it and uses .setTarget to set it as the animation
            of a second View. Then it creates two ObjectAnimator's to: animate the y position
            of an object down, and a second to animate y position up again and creates an AnimatorSet
            to play them sequentially, clones this AnimatorSet and .setTarget's the clone as the
            AnimatorSet for a second object. Uses an AnimatorSet to play the first two ObjectAnimator's
            and first AnimatorSet, requesting that they be run at the same time by calling
            playTogether(ObjectAnimator1,ObjectAnimator2,AnimatorSet1), and the second AnimatorSet
            to run after the first AnimatorSet by calling playSequentially(AnimatorSet1,AnimatorSet2).

  Animation/Custom Evaluator v11 
        .animation.CustomEvaluator
            Implements the TypeEvaluator interface to animate using a custom:
            "public Object evaluate(float fraction, Object startValue, Object endValue)"
            function. The x and y coordinates of an "animation.ShapeHolder ball" are 
            animated by calling evaluate, and onAnimationUpdate is called which calls
            invalidate() which causes the onDraw method to be called.
            TODO: Scale using mDensity = getContext().getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;

  Animation/Default Layout Animations v11 -- layout uses GridLayout so crash,  if < v14.
        .animation.LayoutAnimationsByDefault
            Uses android:animateLayoutChanges="true" in the GridLayout used to contain buttons,
            to automate transition animations using the default animations as Buttons are added
            to or removed from that ViewGroup.            .

  Animation/Events v11
        .animation.AnimatorEvents
            Supposed to show when the various Sequencer Events and Animator Events: 
            Start Repeat Cancel and End occur, but Repeat Events are not generated
            for the Sequencer because the api does not support setRepeatCount on a
            AnimatorSet.

  Animation/Hide-Show Animations v11
        .animation.LayoutAnimationsHideShow
            Uses setLayoutTransition to set default transitions, and setAnimator to 
            specify custom animations if checkbox is checked. Buttons disappear when
            touched using these animations. If "Gone" checkbox is checked, 
            setVisibility is used to set the button's view to View.GONE which means 
            that it takes up no layout space, and the remaining buttons move together
            to fill the now empty space, otherwise it is set to View.INVISIBLE which
            makes it invisible, but it still occupies the same layout space.

  Animation/Layout Animations v11
        .animation.LayoutAnimations
            Adds and removes buttons using custom or default animations. Buttons are 
            too small for the number on ub->htc_one, and i7->Nexus 5 I recall, but 
            perfect on quad->nexus 7, and i7->Excite 10, ub->Nexus 9, k7->LG G pad 8.3,
            and bizarre but true k7->Nexus 4. This problem is due to bug in FixedGridlayout?
            TODO: Scale all use of pixels to dp

  Animation/Loading v11 -> v23 or higher required due to android:fraction="0"
        .animation.AnimationLoading
            Loads animations from Xml files: R.animator.object_animator (animates ball[0] "y"
            from 0 to 200, and reverses), R.animator.animator (animates ball[1] alpha from 1 to
            0 and reverses), R.animator.animator_set (an animator set which animates ball[2]'s
            "x" from 0 to 200, and "y" from 0 to 400), R.animator.color_animator (an animator
            which animates ball[3]'s color from #0f0 to #00ffff), R.animator.object_animator_pvh
            (an animator which animates ball[4]'s "x" from 0 to 400, and "y" from 0 to 200 using
            propertyValuesHolder's), R.animator.object_animator_pvh_kf (uses propertyValuesHolder
            to hold keyframe specs for x and y and uses the default linear interpolator on balls[5]),
            R.animator.value_animator_pvh_kf (uses propertyValuesHolder to hold keyframe specs
            for a value which balls[6] uses in an AnimatorUpdateListener for an alpha animation),
            and R.animator.object_animator_pvh_kf_interpolated (the animation used for balls[7] has an
            accelerate interpolator applied on each keyframe interval instead of the default used on
            balls[5], As these two animations use the exact same path, the effect of the per-keyframe
            interpolator has been made obvious.)

  Animation/Multiple Properties v11
        .animation.MultiPropertyAnimation
            Uses AnimatorSet.playTogether(Animator... items) to play four different 
            animations at once: yBouncer (animates y using a BounceInterpolator), yAlphaBouncer
            (animates y and alpha using an AccelerateInterpolator), whxyBouncer (animates width,
            height, x and y using PropertyValuesHolder's), and yxBouncer (animates y and x
            using Keyframe's to split the animation into three sections with a repeat count of
            one and setRepeatMode(ValueAnimator.REVERSE)), all of which are set up in the method
            createAnimation().

  Animation/Path Animations v11 -- uses android.util.Property crashes if < v14. Also 
        uses android.animation.ObjectAnimator crashes if < v21. Also extends abstract
        class android.animation.TypeConverter crashes if < v21.
        .animation.PathAnimations
            Moves a frog around an android.graphics.Path using six different ways to move
            the View: named_components (Uses the named "x" and "y" properties for individual
            (x, y) coordinates of the Path and sets them on the view object. The setX(float)
            and setY(float) methods are called on view. An int version of this method also
            exists for animating int Properties), property_components (Use two Properties
            for individual (x, y) coordinates of the Path and set them on the view object.
            An int version of this method also exists for animating int Properties.),
            multi_int (Use a multi-int setter to animate along a Path. The method
            setCoordinates(int x, int y) is called on this during the animation. Either
            "setCoordinates" or "coordinates" are acceptable parameters because the "set"
            can be implied.), multi_float (Use a multi-float setter to animate along a Path.
            The method changeCoordinates(float x, float y) is called on this during the
            animation), named_setter (Use the named "point" property to animate along the Path.
            There must be a method setPoint(PointF) on the animated object. Because setPoint
            takes a PointF parameter, no TypeConverter is necessary. In this case, the animated
            object is PathAnimations.), and property_setter (Use the POINT_PROPERTY property
            to animate along the Path. POINT_PROPERTY takes a Point, not a PointF, so the
            TypeConverter PointFToPointConverter is necessary.). The radio buttons to choose
            which way to use need to be in an HorizontalScrollView not a ScrollView in order
            to be seen on narrow screens.

  Animation/Reversing v11
        .animation.ReversingAnimation
            Demonstrates the use of android.animation.ValueAnimator.reverse() method
            to play an animation in "reverse".

  Animation/Seeking v11
        .animation.AnimationSeeking
            Uses a SeekBar to allow user to set the animation to a particular position
            using android.animation.ValueAnimator.setCurrentPlayTime(long playTime)

  Animation/Simple Transitions v11 -- TransitionInflater.from(this) requires v19 as does
        Scene.getSceneForLayout, as does android.transition itself.
        .animation.Transitions
            Uses classes from android.transition to animate transitions between 4 (or 3) 
            different layouts. scene4 is not an actual 'Scene', but rather a dynamic
            change in the UI, transitioned to using beginDelayedTransition() to tell
            the TransitionManager to get ready to run a transition at the next frame.
            It merely re-sizes four of the views in whichever of the first three Scenes
            happens to be displayed at that moment.

  Animation/View Flip v11
        .animation.ListFlipper
            Uses fancy custom ObjectAnimator to swap two list views occupying the same
            space in a LinearLayout, by setting one to android:visibility="gone" and the
            other to android:visibility="visible" when they are to be "flipped", the
            english list starts as the visible list as defined in the Layout xml file.

App
  Action Bar (All Disabled for Froyo)
    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Mechanics v11
        .app.ActionBarMechanics
            Populates its Action Bar programmatically with no xml files used, even
            for the Activity layout.

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Navigation v16 (new Document Flag requires v21)
        .app.ActionBarNavigation goes to:
        .app.ActionBarNavigationTarget
            Shows how to use "Up" button in Action Bar, new Document is created in a 
            separate activity, so you have to use "recent" to switch to it, and then
            the "up" button works as "up", otherwise it works as "Back". Uses the
            attribute android:taskAffinity=":bar_navigation" to associate the activities.

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Tabs v11
        .app.ActionBarTabs
            You need to toggle tab mode before tabs show in action bar. Crashes when rotated
            because it needs a zero argument constructor. The text should be passed in a bundle.
            Working on doing this Right. Did so, but need to use retained fragments in order
            to keep tabs (TODO: add retained fragments to this)

    App/Action Bar/Action Bar Usage v11
        .app.ActionBarUsage
            This demonstrates idiomatic usage of the Action Bar. The default Honeycomb theme
            includes the action bar by default and a menu resource is used to populate the
            menu data itself. If you'd like to see how these things work under the hood, see
            ActionBarMechanics. Shows a bunch of different action bar actions, and how to use
            and configure in both java and xml

    App/Action Bar/Action Provider/Settings Action Provider v14
        .app.ActionBarSettingsActionProviderActivity
            demo creates an ActionProvider for launching the system settings and adds
            a menu item with that provider, in this case it will launch the system
            settings app. Demonstrates how to implement an android.view.ActionProvider

    App/Action Bar/Action Provider/Share Action Provider v14
        .app.ActionBarShareActionProviderActivity
            Shows how to add a Share Action Provider to the Action Bar. Shares robot.png
            packaged with the app in res/raw by copying it to shared.png in the apps 
            private storage area. TODO: replace startActivity with startActivityForResult FOR Gmail
            http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26883259/gmail-5-0-app-fails-with-permission-denied-for-the-attachment-when-it-receives

    App/Action Bar/Display Options v16
        .app.ActionBarDisplayOptions
            Shows how various action bar display option flags can be combined and their
            effects. The flags are: DISPLAY_HOME_AS_UP, DISPLAY_SHOW_HOME, DISPLAY_USE_LOGO,
            DISPLAY_SHOW_TITLE, DISPLAY_SHOW_CUSTOM, all fields in ActionBar. Also you
            can cycle the gravity of the Custom View from START->CENTER_HORIZONTAL->END->START,
            all fields in Gravity, as well as toggle the bar's visibility using ActionBar.hide()
            and ActionBar.show(), and toggle system ui visibility using setSystemUiVisibility(0)
            to make it visible, and setSystemUiVisibility(View.SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN) to
            make it invisible.

  Activity
    App/Activity/Animation                 all
        .app.Animation
        JELLY_BEAN (v16+) required for "modern animations" by java code if/else statement
        animates in to:
        .app.AlertDialogSamples
            Example of using a custom animation when transitioning between activities. 
            Legacy "Fade In" and "Zoom In" use:
            overridePendingTransition(int enterAnim, int exitAnim), where enterAnim and 
            exitAnim are the R.anim.* for xml files in res/anim, (R.anim.fade, R.anim.hold)
            for the "Fade In" animation, and (R.anim.zoom_enter, R.anim.zoom_exit) for 
            the "Zoom In" animation.
            The modern versions of these use ActivityOptions.makeCustomAnimation() and
            ActivityOptions.toBundle() to pass the animations to the startActivity function.
            The "Scale Up" animation uses ActivityOptions.makeScaleUpAnimation and the
            "Thumbnail Scale Up" animation uses ActivityOptions.makeThumbnailScaleUpAnimation
            to create options to bundle with toBundle to pass to the startActivity function.

    App/Activity/Custom Dialog             all
        .app.CustomDialogActivity
            Creates a pop-up activity over the App/Activity list which looks like a dialog, and
            uses a android:theme="@style/Theme.CustomDialog" set in the AndroidManifest.

    App/Activity/Custom Title              all
        .app.CustomTitle
            How to use a custom title. Uses Window.FEATURE_CUSTOM_TITLE to create a 
            custom title bar from layout/custom_title_1 for the activity, and allows
            the user to change the title.

    App/Activity/Dialog                    all
        .app.DialogActivity
            Creates a Dialog using a style derived from a theme that is appropriate 
            and available given the Api level: style/ThemeCurrentDialog is defined in
            each: values/styles.xml values-v11/styles.xml values-v19/styles.xml and
            values-v20/styles.xml with the parent set to android:Theme.Dialog, 
            android:Theme.Holo.Dialog, android:Theme.Material.Dialog, and
            android:Theme.Material.Light.Dialog respectively.

    App/Activity/Finish Affinity           v16
        .app.FinishAffinity
            Show how to end a deeply nested stack of activities, returning to the 
            activity at the very top. It does this by calling finishAffinity() which
            finishes this activity as well as all activities immediately below it in 
            the current task that have the same affinity.

    App/Activity/Forwarding                all
        .app.Forwarding
            Example of removing yourself from the history stack after forwarding to 
            another activity. This is simply done by calling finish() after calling 
            startActivity(Intent).

    App/Activity/<b>Hello <i>World</i></b> all
        .app.HelloWorld
            Simple app which only displays a layout containing a single TextView.

    App/Activity/Intent Activity Flags     all -> v11
        .app.IntentActivityFlags
            This activity demonstrates how to build a backstack of activities into an
            array of Intent[] and use it to replace the current backstack by using 
            makeRestartActivityTask() to create Intent[0] with the flags set to 
            re-launch ApiDemos task in its base state, Intent[1] to launch ApiDemos
            at the "Views" "com.example.android.apis.Path", Intent[2] to launch
            ApiDemos at the "Views/Lists" "com.example.android.apis.Path" and requesting
            to reset the back stack to these three "activities". It then launches these
            intents using startActivities() if the FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK button is
            pressed, or putting them into a PendingIntent which it "later" calls using
            PendingIntent.send()

    App/Activity/Intents                   all
        .app.Intents
            Uses Intent.createChooser(Intent, "title") to create a "chooser intent" 
            from three different mime types ("audio/*", "image/*", and "*/*") of
            Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT Intents based on which button the user clicks,
            and it then hands the created "chooser Intent" to startActivity(Intent)

    App/Activity/Overscan                  v18
        .app.OverscanActivity
            Uses @android:style/Theme.Holo.NoActionBar.Overscan set in AndroidManifest,
            and android:fitsSystemWindows="true" in its layout/overscan_activity.xml to
            place a surrounding "white box" in the overscan region of the display, and
            displays a picture in a FrameLayout offset to avoid the overscan region.

    App/Activity/Persistent State          all
        .app.PersistentState
            Demonstrates saving and restoring activity state by using a
            SharedPreferences.Editor to save state in the onPause() callback, then 
            restoring the state in the onResume callback.

    App/Activity/Presentation -- registerDisplayListener v17 getSupportedModes v23
        .app.PresentationActivity
            Presents a presentation on a secondary display. (Needs secondary display.)

    App/Activity/Presentation with Media Router MediaRouter needs v17
        .app.PresentationWithMediaRouterActivity
            The activity uses the MediaRouter API to automatically detect when a 
            presentation display is available and to allow the user to control the
            media routes using a menu item.  When a presentation display is available,
            we stop showing content in the main activity and instead open up a  
            Presentation on the preferred presentation display.

    App/Activity/QuickContactsDemo         all
        .app.QuickContactsDemo
            Shows how to query the contacts database using a cursor, and display the
            results in a ListActivity hosted ListView. It uses a deprecated api which
            queries the database on the UI thread -- it is better to use LoaderManager
            with a CursorLoader. See the documentation for LoaderManager for an example
            of how to do this. TODO: write LoaderManager version.

    App/Activity/Receive Result            all
        .app.ReceiveResult
            Show how to start a second activity (.app.SendResult) to generate a result,
            receive it using startActivityForResult(intent, GET_CODE), followed on completion
            by the callback onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data).
            It launches the Activity SendResult, which then returns the result using
            setResult(RESULT_OK, (new Intent()).setAction("Corky!")), followed by
            finish().

    App/Activity/Recreate                  v11
        .app.ActivityRecreate
            Uses setTheme(theme) followed by recreate() to cycle through three different 
            Holo themes (original version did not initialize the field that the current 
            theme is kept in, causing it to crash on Material Light default devices.)

    App/Activity/Redirection               all
        .app.RedirectEnter
            Consists of three activities: RedirectEnter, RedirectGetter, and RedirectMain.
            RedirectGetter stores user input in the shared preference file "RedirectData"
            RedirectEnter just describes what will happen, and when the "Go" button is 
            clicked starts up RedirectMain, which immediately starts RedirectGetter if 
            there is no data stored in "RedirectData" yet, if there is data it will display
            it and give the user the options to either "Clear and Exit" back to RedirectEnter,
            or "New Text" which restarts RedirectGetter. RedirectMain uses the request 
            codes INIT_TEXT_REQUEST, and NEW_TEXT_REQUEST that it sends in the Intent to 
            RedirectGetter to determine what to do if the result code was RESULT_CANCELED,
            either finish() back to RedirectEnter, or just display the old text.

    App/Activity/Reorder Activities        all
        .app.ReorderOnLaunch
            ReorderOnLaunch is the first of a sequence of four Activities: ReorderTwo,
            ReorderThree, and ReoderFour follow.  A button on the fourth will use the 
            Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_REORDER_TO_FRONT flag to bring the second of the 
            activities to the front of the history stack. After that, proceeding back
            through the history should begin with the newly-frontmost second reorder 
            activity, then the fourth, the third, and finally the first.

    App/Activity/Rotation Animation        v18+ or crash
        .app.RotationAnimation
            Allows you to choose the animation that occurs when the screen is rotated:
            either ROTATION_ANIMATION_ROTATE, ROTATION_ANIMATION_CROSSFADE, or 
            ROTATION_ANIMATION_JUMPCUT.

    App/Activity/Save &amp; Restore State  all
        .app.SaveRestoreState              Broken? Or too much memory for a kill needed.
            Supposed to show that only EditText with an "id" assigned to the view will
            have its state preserved, but both EditText views remember text entered after
            switching to another app and back. However if you rotate screen then only the
            state of the EditText with android:freezesText="true" is saved, the new content
            of other EditText is forgotten.

    App/Activity/Screen Orientation        all -- v18+ required for full use
        .app.ScreenOrientation
            Lets the user choose the screen orientation programmatically -- some orientations
            are only available for v9+, and some only for v18+ but froyo ignores them rather 
            than crashes. Very nice example of spinner layout and use.

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Dialog          all
        .app.SecureDialogActivity
            Shows a secure dialog by setting WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE on an
            AlertDialog before calling dialog.show()

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Surface View    all
        .app.SecureSurfaceViewActivity                  v17+ or Crash
            This activity demonstrates how to make a SurfaceView use a secure surface so 
            that its contents will only be visible on secure displays. The surface view's
            window has been made secure using setSecure(true) to make it use a secure 
            surface.

    App/Activity/Secure Surfaces/Secure Window          all
        .app.SecureWindowActivity
            This activity demonstrates how to make an activity use a secure surface so
            that its contents will only be visible on secure displays. The activity's 
            window has been marked with FLAG_SECURE by calling:

            getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE,
                                 WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE);

            in the onCreate callback just after calling setContentView to make it use
            a secure surface.

    App/Activity/SetWallpaper              all
        .app.SetWallpaperActivity
            This demonstrates the how to write an activity that gets the current system 
            wallpaper, modifies it and sets the modified bitmap as system wallpaper. The
            image it uses is too small for larger screens because the current wallpaper
            is compressed to fit in the ImageView used by the layout, which is then used
            to set the new wallpaper.

    App/Activity/Soft Input Modes          all
        .app.SoftInputModes
            Shows how the various soft input modes: "Unspecified" (The system will try to
            pick one or the other depending on the contents of the window); "Resize"
            (allow the window to be resized when an input method is shown, so that its
            contents are not covered by the input method); "Pan" (window will pan when
            an input method is shown, so it doesn't need to deal with resizing but is just
            panned by the framework to ensure the current input focus is visible); and
            "Nothing" (window will not adjust for a shown input method. The window will
            not be resized, and it will not be panned to make its focus visible) effect
            the resizing of the UI windows when the IME is displayed. They are set with:
            getWindow().setSoftInputMode(mResizeModeValues[position])

    App/Activity/Translucent               all
        .app.TranslucentActivity
            Sets the theme on the window in AndroidManifest to @style/Theme.Translucent
            which is derived in styles.xml from android:style/Theme.Translucent, thereby
            causing the window to be composited over whatever is behind it.

    App/Activity/Translucent Blur          all Not Blurred enough on lollipop
        .app.TranslucentBlurActivity
            This is the same as .app.TranslucentActivity, with the background blurred on
            older api's - WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_BLUR_BEHIND is no longer 
            supported as of API level 14, so Lollipop does not blur at all.

    App/Activity/Wallpaper                 all
        .app.WallpaperActivity
            This is an app which has the system wallpaper behind it. It does this by 
            setting the theme on the window in AndroidManifest to Theme.Wallpaper,
            which inherits from the system theme android:style/Theme.Wallpaper, which
            has android:windowShowWallpaper = "true".

  Alarm
    App/Alarm/Alarm Controller             all
        .app.AlarmController
            Shows how to schedule both one-shot alarms (OneShotAlarm.java), and repeating
            alarms (RepeatingAlarm.java) using AlarmManager.set() for one-shot and 
            AlarmManager.setRepeating() for the repeating alarm. OneShotAlarm and RepeatingAlarm
            are declared as <receiver>'s in AndroidManifest.xml

    App/Alarm/Alarm Service                all
        .app.AlarmService
            This demonstrates how you can schedule an alarm that causes a service to be
            started (.app.AlarmService_Service)  This is useful when you want to schedule 
            alarms that initiate long-running operations, such as retrieving recent e-mails.
            Note: as of API 19, all repeating alarms are inexact. If your application needs
            precise delivery times then it must use one-time exact alarms, rescheduling each
            time. Legacy applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will
            continue to have all of their alarms, including repeating alarms, treated as exact.

  Alert Dialogs
    App/Alert Dialogs                      all (v11+ or crash for some)
        .app.AlertDialogSamples
            Allows you to create different types of dialogs: DIALOG_YES_NO_MESSAGE = 1;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_LONG_MESSAGE = 2; DIALOG_LIST = 3; DIALOG_PROGRESS = 4;
            DIALOG_SINGLE_CHOICE = 5; DIALOG_MULTIPLE_CHOICE = 6; DIALOG_TEXT_ENTRY = 7;
            DIALOG_MULTIPLE_CHOICE_CURSOR = 8; DIALOG_YES_NO_ULTRA_LONG_MESSAGE = 9;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_OLD_SCHOOL_MESSAGE = 10; DIALOG_YES_NO_HOLO_LIGHT_MESSAGE = 11;
            DIALOG_YES_NO_DEFAULT_LIGHT_MESSAGE = 12; DIALOG_YES_NO_DEFAULT_DARK_MESSAGE = 13;
            and DIALOG_PROGRESS_SPINNER = 14. It does this by calling showDialog with the
            int identifying the dialog to be shown, and overriding "Dialog onCreateDialog(int id)"
            which uses a switch to branch between code needed to create the Dialog which it
            returns. All this is very deprecated - TODO: Write a DialogFragment version.

  Device Admin
    App/Device Admin                       Works only on newer versions(?) v23+ or crash
        .app.DeviceAdminSample
            Shows how to implement a comprehensive UI for exploring and operating the 
            DevicePolicyManager api. TODO: work up enough courage to play around with this (lem?)

  Fragment                                 v11+ for all samples
    App/Fragment/Alert Dialog              v11
        .app.FragmentAlertDialog
            Demonstrates how to show an AlertDialog that is managed by a Fragment. Uses
            DialogFragment as base class and overrides onCreateDialog in which it builds
            the AlertDialog using an AlertDialog.Builder

    App/Fragment/Arguments                 v11
        .app.FragmentArguments
            Demonstrates a fragment that can be configured through both Bundle arguments
            and layout attributes. Different layout in landscape, including an extra 
            fragment configured within the landscape layout only.

    App/Fragment/Context Menu              v11
        .app.FragmentContextMenu
            Demonstration of displaying a context menu from a fragment.

    App/Fragment/Custom Animations         v11 -> v21 due to getDrawable call
        .app.FragmentCustomAnimations
            Uses FragmentTransaction.setCustomAnimations to cause animations to be used
            when replacing one fragment with the next. The "POP" button does the same thing
            as the back button by calling onBackPressed, it takes you back through the numbered
            fragments on the stack after you "Push" them, again using the same animation.
            onSaveInstanceState saves the mStackLevel in an int "level" which is used when
            the Activity is recreated to remember the stack level, mStackLevel is then used
            to set the int argument "num" passed to the new fragment when it is created.

    App/Fragment/Dialog                    v11
        .app.FragmentDialog
            Example of displaying dialogs with a DialogFragment. Press the show button
            at the bottom to see the first dialog; pressing successive show buttons on 
            the dialogs will display other dialog styles as a stack, with back going to
            the previous dialog. The various styles are: STYLE_NO_TITLE; STYLE_NO_FRAME;
            STYLE_NO_INPUT (this window can't receive input, so you will need to press 
            the bottom show button); STYLE_NORMAL with dark fullscreen theme; STYLE_NORMAL
            with light theme; STYLE_NO_TITLE with light theme; STYLE_NO_FRAME with light 
            theme; STYLE_NORMAL with light fullscreen theme; and STYLE_NORMAL.

    App/Fragment/Dialog or Activity        v11
        .app.FragmentDialogOrActivity
            Shows how to show the same DialogFragment embedded in the activity layout,
            and as a dialog.

    App/Fragment/Hide and Show             v11
        .app.FragmentHideShow
            Demonstration of hiding and showing fragments while keeping fragment state
            using FragmentTransaction.hide(Fragment), and FragmentTransaction.show(Fragment).
            The Fragment's are created in the layout using the <fragment> xml element.
            TODO: fix display of show/hide Button text after rotation.

    App/Fragment/Layout                    v11
        .app.FragmentLayout                CRASHES both Xcite and Nexus 7 (fixed)
            Demonstration of using fragments to implement different activity layouts.
            This sample provides a different layout (and activity flow) when run in
            landscape. It crashes as is in landscape mode because of a reference to the
            non-existent containerViewId R.id.a_item in the call at line 156: 
                  (FragmentTransaction) ft.replace(R.id.a_item, details)
            This was obviously added by a runaway modification script, and the container
            id should be R.id.details

    App/Fragment/List Array                v11
        .app.FragmentListArray
            Uses a ListFragment as the sole content of the activities window, using
            setListAdapter to set the list to display an array created using:
            ArrayAdapter<String>(getActivity(), android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1, Shakespeare.TITLES));
                                 Context        Layout file TextField to display in   Array of Strings
            It overrides onListItemClick simply to log the id of the item clicked.

    App/Fragment/Menu                      v11
        .app.FragmentMenu
            Builds menus from two fragments, allowing you to hide them to remove them.

    App/Fragment/Nesting Tabs              v17
        .app.FragmentNestingTabs
            Uses tabs in the ActionBar to select between other activities in App/Fragment:
            FragmentMenuFragment.java, FragmentArgumentsFragment.java, FragmentStackFragment.java,
            FragmentTabsFragment.java. Uses FragmentManager.enableDebugLogging(true) to produce
            debugging info from  the FragmentManager (very useful)

    App/Fragment/Receive Result            v11
        .app.FragmentReceiveResult
            FragmentReceiveResult builds a FrameLayout in java -- no xml layout. To this it adds
            the Fragment ReceiveResultFragment which uses the layout R.layout.receive_result. Then
            it starts the activity SendResult (startActivityForResult) which returns the
            users input in an intent setResult(RESULT_OK, (new Intent()).setAction("Corky!"))
            which FragmentReceiveResult receives in the callback onActivityResult and then
            appends it to the Editable TextView id R.id.results contained in the layout
            R.layout.receive_result.

    App/Fragment/Retain Instance           v11
        .app.FragmentRetainInstance
            Work fragment/thread calls setRetainInstance(true) in its onCreate callback, 
            causing it and the thread it is running to be retained when the device configuration
            changes. Shows how you can use a Fragment to easily propagate state (such as 
            threads) across activity instances when an activity needs to be restarted. This is
            a lot easier than using the raw Activity.onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() API.

    App/Fragment/Stack                     v11 -> crashes less than v16
        .app.FragmentStack
            Shows how to push and pop fragments using the system backstack. 
            FragmentTransaction.addToBackStack() adds the fragement to the backstack, and
            getFragmentManager().popBackStack() (or simply pressing "back" button) goes back
            one fragment, using a fancy animation for push and pop. (Not really visible on
            Nexus 6 Marshmallow, but striking on Excite 10.)

    App/Fragment/Tabs                      v11 -> v13 because of .detach
        .app.FragmentTabs
            This demonstrates the use of action bar tabs and how they interact with other
            action bar features. The Activities chosen to populate the tabs all have 
            their own uses for the action bar, and they are switched in and out by a 
            class which implements ActionBar.TabListener (TabListener<T extends Fragment>)

  Launcher Shortcuts
    App/Launcher Shortcuts                 all
        .app.LauncherShortcuts
            Supposed to show all that goes into creating a shortcut, and responding 
            to it, but could not get it to work.
            TODO: separate Activity into its own Application

  Loader
    App/Loader/Cursor                      v11
        .app.LoaderCursor
            Creates a custom class CursorLoaderListFragment which extends ListFragment, 
            with the necessary callbacks to serve as a CursorLoader to load and display 
            contacts data in the ListFragment. Includes the use of a SearchView which
            might come in handy for MarkovChain

    App/Loader/Custom                      v11 -> v14
        .app.LoaderCustom
            Shows how to implement a custom AsyncTaskLoader, it uses the system function
            PackageManager.getInstalledApplications to retrieve a List<ApplicationInfo> 
            containing the AndroidManifest information for all the installed apps.

    App/Loader/Retained                    v11 -> v14
        .app.LoaderRetained
            Shows how to retain a ListFragment by calling setRetainInstance(true) in the
            onActivityCreated callback.

    App/Loader/Throttle                    v11
        .app.LoaderThrottle
            Implements a custom CursorLoader which pretends to be a SQLite database, and
            simulates a slow provider of data LoaderThrottle$SimpleProvider

  Menu
    App/Menu/Inflate from XML              all -> v14
        .app.MenuInflateFromXml            crashes froyo invalidateOptionsMenu()
            Lets you choose from a bunch of different xml menus: R.menu.title_only, 
            R.menu.title_icon, R.menu.submenu, R.menu.groups, R.menu.checkable, 
            R.menu.shortcuts, R.menu.order, R.menu.category_order, R.menu.visible, 
            and R.menu.disabled and use MenuInflater.inflate to inflate them.
            R.menu.title_icon does not show the icon (boo hoo!), but oddly enough
            the submenu does?

  Notification
    App/Notification/IncomingMessage       all -> v16
        .app.IncomingMessage               interstitial crashes froyo startActivities()
            Allows you to choose between a regular app notification, and an interstitial
            notification and shows how to launch IncomingMessageView from either type of
            notification. The interstitial choice launches IncomingMessageInterstitial 
            which on clicking the "Switch to App" button uses the same function as the 
            non-interstitial notification to launch IncomingMessageView.

    App/Notification/Notifying Service Controller  -- all -> v16
        .app.NotifyingService
            Updates a notification every 5 seconds from a background thread. Note use of
            ConditionVariable to implement the condition variable locking paradigm, blocking
            for 5*1000 miliseconds after every notification (very useful approach).


    App/Notification/NotifyWithText        all
        .app.NotifyWithText
            Show notification in a Toast.

    App/Notification/Status Bar            all -> v16
        .app.StatusBarNotifications
            froyo crash -- sound/vibrate/all calls: Intent.makeRestartActivityTask() 
            and PendingIntent.getActivities() -> v11+ only. Displays icon, and text when
            buttons pressed. Marquee does not work lollipop.

  Print
    App/Print/Print Bitmap                 v19
        .app.PrintBitmap
            Shows how to print a Bitmap. Uses ImageView.getDrawable()).getBitmap(); to
            retrieve a bitmap of the drawable used in the screen, then to print it uses:
            PrintHelper.printBitmap("Print Bitmap", bitmap);

    App/Print/Print Custom Layout          v19
        .app.PrintCustomContent
            Nifty example of a ListActivity with a custom ListAdapter, but it also shows
            how to allow the user to specify options for the printout, and then re-layout
            the pdf canvas View to reflect those changes when it comes time to print.

    App/Print/Print HTML from screen       v19
        .app.PrintHtmlFromScreen
            Uses a WebView as the View for the app, which allows it to use 
            WebView.createPrintDocumentAdapter() to print using PrintManager.print()

    App/Print/Print HTML off screen        v19
        .app.PrintHtmlOffScreen
            This activity shows a text prompt and when the user chooses the print option
            from the overflow menu an HTML page with content that is not on the screen
             is printed via an off-screen WebView.

  Search
    App/Search/Invoke Search               all
        .app.SearchInvoke
            This activity shows a few different ways to invoke search, and inserts 
            context-specific data for use by the search activity.

    App/Search/Query Search Results        all
        .app.SearchQueryResults
            This activity accepts query strings via the ACTION_SEARCH intent.  In a 
            full implementation, you would use the query string to select results from
            your data source, and present a list of those results to the user. Does not
            actually do anything unless the device has a "Search Key" like Froyo does.

  Service
    App/Service/Foreground Service Controller  -- all -> v19
        .app.ForegroundService$Controller
            This demonstrates how you can implement services that run in the foreground
            when needed. Informative use of new Class[] TODO: Study reflection!

    App/Service/Isolated Service Controller    -- v16
        .app.IsolatedService$Controller
            Show how to use android:isolatedProcess="true" AndroidManifest option for
            a service -- the "two" services .app.IsolatedService and .app.IsolatedService2
            do absolutely nothing so there is no way to tell.

    App/Service/Local Service Binding          -- all
        .app.LocalServiceActivities$Binding
            This demonstrates the implementation of a service that runs in the same 
            process as the rest of the application, which is explicitly started and 
            stopped as desired. Binds to app.LocalService.java

    App/Service/Local Service Controller       -- all
        .app.LocalServiceActivities$Controller
            Example of explicitly starting and stopping the local service. Starts 
            app.LocalService.java

    App/Service/Messenger Service              -- all -> v16
        .app.MessengerServiceActivities$Binding
            This is an example of implementing an application service that uses the
            Messenger class for communicating with clients.  This allows for remote
            interaction with a service, without needing to define an AIDL interface.

        .app.RemoteService$Binding                Service Intent must be explicit: line 364
            This is an example of implementing an application service that runs in a 
            different process than the application.  Because it can be in another
            process, we must use IPC to interact with it.  The Controller and Binding
            classes show how to interact with the service.

            the formula once for each of red, green and blue)

            The resulting values are specified as a pair in square braces as follows.

            [<alpha-value>,<color-value>]

        .graphics.ColorFilters
            Applies a PorterDuffColorFilter to tint some button like drawables using several
            different colors, and both PorterDuff.Mode.SRC_ATOP, and PorterDuff.Mode.MULTIPLY
            PorterDuff modes to apply them. Oddly only froyo spaces the drawables properly 
            probably due to the use of drawable-mdpi and drawable-hdpi versions. Checking
            Drawable.getIntrinsicHeight() and modifying the spacing for hdpi fixes the problem.

  ColorMatrix
    Graphics/ColorMatrix                   all
        .graphics.ColorMatrixSample
            Uses ColorMatrixColorFilter's to create three different versions of a jpeg, 
            animating them through different "contrasts". One changes both scale and 
            translate, one changes scale only, and one changes translate only. (The original
            is at top of left column, scale and translate to right of it, scale only second row,
            and translate only is in the third row.)

  Compass
    Graphics/Compass                       all
        .graphics.Compass
            Displays a compass pointer which it rotates according to SensorEvent it receives

  Layers
    Graphics/Layers                        all
        .graphics.Layers
            Shows the use of Canvas.saveLayerAlpha() and Canvas.restore() to save and restore
            Canvas settings while doing some drawing in an off screen buffer.

  MeasureText
    Graphics/MeasureText                   all
        .graphics.MeasureText
            Shows how to use the text measurement methods: Paint.getTextWidths(), 
            Paint.measureText(), and Paint.getTextBounds() to determine what area
            each character in a string as well as the complete string will occupy 
            when they are drawn using Canvas.drawText, then draws a colored rectangle
            around each string and a line under each at the baseline. Text was too
            small so I modified it a bit.

  OpenGL ES
   Compressed Texture
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Compressed Texture  all
        .graphics.CompressedTextureActivity
            Demonstrate how to use ETC1 format compressed textures. This sample can be
            recompiled to use either resource-based textures (compressed offline using
            the etc1tool), or textures created on the fly by compressing images.

   Cube Map
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Cube Map            all
        .graphics.CubeMapActivity
            Demonstrate how to use the OES_texture_cube_map extension, available on some
            high-end OpenGL ES 1.x GPUs. Shows how to load and use GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP
            textures to animate a gyrating Torus.

   Frame Buffer Object
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Frame Buffer Object all
        .graphics.FrameBufferObjectActivity
            Demonstrate the Frame Buffer Object OpenGL ES extension. This sample renders
            a scene into an offscreen frame buffer, and then uses the resulting image as
            a texture to render an onscreen scene.

   GLSurfaceView
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/GLSurfaceView       all
        .graphics.GLSurfaceViewActivity
            Wrapper activity demonstrating the use of GLSurfaceView, a view that uses OpenGL
            drawing into a dedicated surface. Uses CubeRenderer to render a pair of tumbling
            cubes created and draw(n) by Cube.java

   Kube
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Kube                all

   Matrix Palette Skinning
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Matrix Palette Skinning  -- all
        .graphics.MatrixPaletteActivity
            This sample shows how to implement a Matrix Palette, used to rock a column
            back and forth.

   OpenGL ES 2.0
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/OpenGL ES 2.0       all
        .graphics.GLES20Activity
            This sample shows how to check for OpenGL ES 2.0 support at runtime, and then
            use either OpenGL ES 1.0 or OpenGL ES 2.0, as appropriate. Since even froyo 
            uses 2.0 this is not all that important it seems. Does show a simple example
            of using Vertex shaders, and Fragment shaders (Pixel shaders).

   Sprite Text
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Sprite Text         all
        .graphics.spritetext.SpriteTextActivity
            Shows how to add text to a GLSurfaceView using OpenGL labels. OpenGL labels 
            are implemented by creating a Bitmap, drawing all the labels into the Bitmap,
            converting the Bitmap into an Alpha texture, and drawing portions of the
            texture using glDrawTexiOES. The benefits of this approach are that the 
            labels are drawn using the high quality anti-aliased font rasterizer, full
            character set support, and all the text labels are stored on a single texture, 
            which makes it faster to use. The drawbacks are that you can only have as many
            labels as will fit onto one texture, and you have to recreate the whole 
            texture if any label text changes. Characters are too small on lollipop, okay
            on froyo.

   Textured Triangle
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Textured Triangle   all
        .graphics.TriangleActivity
            Shows a rotating triangle using a bitmap made from raw/robot.png as the 
            texture. It uses a GLSurfaceView.Renderer that uses the Android-specific 
            android.opengl.GLESXXX static OpenGL ES APIs. The static APIs expose more 
            of the OpenGL ES features than the javax.microedition.khronos.opengles APIs,
            and also provide a programming model that is closer to the C OpenGL ES APIs, 
            which may make it easier to reuse code and documentation written for the C 
            OpenGL ES APIs.

   Touch Rotate
    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Touch Rotate        all
        .graphics.TouchRotateActivity
            Shows how to redraw in response to user input. Draws a cube, and allows the
            user to rotate it using their finger. TODO: Implement molecule demo.

    Graphics/OpenGL ES/Translucent GLSurfaceView  -- all
        .graphics.TranslucentGLSurfaceViewActivity
            Sets the background of the GLSurfaceView of a CubeRenderer to Translucent, 
            allowing the user to see the ApiDemos application behind the rotating cube.

  PathEffects
    Graphics/PathEffects                   all
        .graphics.PathEffects
            Shows how to use the PathEffect classes to make animated dashed lines, and 
            smoothed, rounded lines. TODO: scale lines for high dpi screens.

  PathFillTypes
    Graphics/PathFillTypes                 all
        .graphics.PathFillTypes
            Shows the effect of four different Path.FillType's on the same Path, which
            consists of two intersecting circles:

  Patterns
    Graphics/Patterns                      all
        .graphics.Patterns
            Creates two Bitmap's: a blue rectangle on a red background, and a green 
            circle on a clear background. It uses these Bitmap's to make two 
            BitmapShader's, and it rotates the Circle BitmapShader by 30 degrees.
            In the onDraw method it first draws using the rectangle pattern, translate's
            the Canvas based on the current MotionEvent movement and draws using the
            circle pattern. The effect is to allow you to move the circle pattern with
            your finger while leaving the rectangle pattern stationary and visible 
            through the circle pattern on top.

  Pictures

            calling Picture.endRecording() the Picture  is turned into a Drawable by
            calling PictureDrawable(Picture). Then in the onDraw method it first draws
            the Picture using the Canvas.drawPicture(Picture) method then it stretches
            the Picture when drawing using the Canvas.drawPicture(Picture,RectF) method,
            then it draws the Drawable it created with PictureDrawable(Picture) to draw
            using Drawable.draw(Canvas), then it writes the Picture to a ByteArrayOutputStream
            and draws it by reading that ByteArrayOutputStream back in and then drawing it
            using Canvas.drawPicture(Picture.createFromStream(is))

  Points

            show the item's picture. When the user clicks the picture, it flips to show 
            the list. The animation is made of two smaller animations: the first half 
            rotates the list by 90 degrees on the Y axis and the second half rotates the
            picture by 90 degrees on the Y axis. When the first half finishes, the list

            Demonstrates creating a Screen that uses custom views. This example uses
            com.example.android.apis.view.LabelView.java -- the attributes it accepts
            are defined in the file values/attrs.xml

Date Widgets
    Views/Date Widgets/1. Dialog           all
        .view.DateWidgets1
            Basic example of using date and time widgets, including android.app.TimePickerDialog
            and android.widget.DatePicker. Also provides a good example of using Activity#onCreateDialog,
            Activity#onPrepareDialog and Activity#showDialog to have the activity automatically
            save and restore the state of the dialogs. Nifty TimePickerDialog on Nexus 6, lame one
            on Jellybean

    Views/Date Widgets/2. Inline           all
        .view.DateWidgets2
            Shows the use of an inline TimePicker. Neat on M lame on J

Drag and Drop
    Views/Drag and Drop                    v11
        .view.DragAndDropDemo
            Shows how to implement draggable views.


Expandable Lists
    Views/Expandable Lists/1. Custom Adapter  -- all -- v17+ or crash
        .view.ExpandableList1
            Demonstrates expandable lists using a custom ExpandableListAdapter from
            BaseExpandableListAdapter. The custom BaseExpandableListAdapter groups
            different child lists under group names: "People Names", "Dog Names", 
            "Cat Names", and "Fish Names". When clicked the groups expand to show the
            child lists, any child or group which is long-pressed will pop up a context
            menu with an "action button".
            TODO: Scale TextSize and TextView for high dpi

    Views/Expandable Lists/2. Cursor (People) -- all -- crashes on froyo: null pointer
        .view.ExpandableList2
            Demonstrates expandable lists backed by Cursors -- uses Contacts data base to
            retrieve names and when a name is clicked expands to show the phone numbers 
            for that name.

    Views/Expandable Lists/3. Simple Adapter  -- all
        .view.ExpandableList3
            Demonstrates expandable lists backed by a Simple Map-based adapter, which is
            created using SimpleExpandableListAdapter

Focus
    Views/Focus/1. Vertical                all
        .view.Focus1
            Demonstrates the use of non-focusable views: caused by android:focusable="false" 
            in layout file layout/focus_1.xml

    Views/Focus/2. Horizontal              all
        .view.Focus2
            Uses android:nextFocusRight="@+id/rightButton" to skip middle button -- need
            input device suitable for changing focus.

    Views/Focus/3. Circular                all
        .view.Focus3
            Uses android:nextFocusDown="@+id/bottom", android:nextFocusLeft="@+id/left",
            android:nextFocusUp="@+id/top", and android:nextFocusRight="@+id/right" to
            specify focus behavior that would be difficult with default focus calculation 
            algorithm -- need input device suitable for changing focus.

    Views/Focus/4. Internal Selection      all
        .view.InternalSelectionFocus
            android.view.View#requestFocus(int, android.graphics.Rect) and 
            android.view.View#onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)
            work together to give a newly focused item a hint about the most interesting
            rectangle of the previously focused view.  The view taking focus can use this
            to set an internal selection more appropriate using this rect.
            This Activity exercises that behavior using three adjacent InternalSelectionView
            that report interesting rects when giving up focus, and use interesting rects
            when taking focus to best select the internal row to show as selected.
            Were InternalSelectionView not to override android.view.View#getFocusedRect, or
            android.view.View#onFocusChanged(boolean, int, android.graphics.Rect)}, the focus 
            would jump to some default internal selection (the top) and not allow for the 
            smooth handoff. Need keys to move focus, so I do not know what this does.

    Views/Focus/5. Sequential (Tab Order)  all
        .view.Focus5
            Demonstrates using nextFocusForward in the layout/focus_5.xml to explicitly 
            set sequential focus order. Not for touch only.

    Views/Focus/6. Window Focus Observer   all  -- v18+ or crash
        .view.WindowFocusObserver
            Impliments a WindowId.FocusObserver() whose onFocusGained(WindowId) merely
            prints "Gained focus", and whose onFocusLost(WindowId) prints "Lost focus".
            Nothing happens on a touch only screen of course.

Game Controller Input
    Views/Game Controller Input            all
        .view.GameControllerInput
            Demonstrates how to process input events received from game controllers.
            It also shows how to detect when input devices are added, removed or 
            reconfigured.
            This activity displays button states and joystick positions. Also writes 
            detailed information about relevant input events to the log. The game 
            controller is also uses to control a very simple game.  See GameView
            for the game itself. No game controller here.

Grid
    Views/Grid/1. Icon Grid                all
        .view.Grid1
            Shows how to use a GridView to display a grid of ImageView's created from
            the app icons retrieved from the PackageManager
            TODO: Scale for high dpi screens

    Views/Grid/2. Photo Grid               all
        .view.Grid2
            Shows how to use a GridView created from resource jpg's using 
            ImageView.setImageResource
            TODO: Scale for high dpi screens

    Views/Grid/3. Selection Mode           all -- v11+ or crash
        .view.Grid3
            Implements multi-selection mode on GridView - hard to select by touch though
            TODO: Scale for high dpi screens

Hover Events
    Views/Hover Events                     all -- v14+ or crash View.OnHoverListener()
        .view.Hover
            No idea what this is supposed to do -- need mouse.

ImageButton
    Views/ImageButton                      all
        .view.ImageButton1
            Simply shows how to draw images on buttons using the SDK stock image.

ImageView
    Views/ImageView                        all
        .view.ImageView1
            Shows how to control scaling in an ImageView in a layout file using:
            android:layout_width, android:layout_height, android:maxWidth, and 
            android:maxHeight and other attributes of ImageView.

Layout Animation
    Views/Layout Animation/1. Grid Fade    all
        .view.LayoutAnimation1
            Uses @anim/layout_grid_fade.xml and @anim/fade.xml to fade in app icons
            in a GridView

    Views/Layout Animation/2. List Cascade all
        .view.LayoutAnimation2
            Shows how to use a LayoutAnimationController to animate the layout of a list
            in a ListActivity Too fast on Nexus 6 to see effect
            TODO: slow down animation for fast devices.

    Views/Layout Animation/3. Reverse Order  -- all
        .view.LayoutAnimation3
            Same as List Cascade above, only using reverse order as specified in
            anim/layout_bottom_to_top_slide.xml using anim/slide_right instead of
            implementing animation in code

    Views/Layout Animation/4. Randomize    all
        .view.LayoutAnimation4
            Uses a layoutAnimation with android:animationOrder="random" and an alpha
            animation specified in anim/fade.xml to fade in app icons in random order.

    Views/Layout Animation/5. Grid Direction  -- all
        .view.LayoutAnimation5
            Uses android:layoutAnimation="@anim/layout_grid_inverse_fade" with 
            android:directionPriority="row", and android:direction="right_to_left|bottom_to_top"
            along with anim/fade.xml to fade in app icons in a grid from bottom right to top left
            instead of top down order.

    Views/Layout Animation/6. Wave Scale   all
        .view.LayoutAnimation6
            Uses android:layoutAnimation="@anim/layout_wave_scale" animation set to 1. Fade in app
            icons, 2. Scale them in from .5 size, to 1.5 size, 3. Scale back from 1.5 to 1.0 size.

    Views/Layout Animation/7. Nested Animations  -- all
        .view.LayoutAnimation7
            Creates an animation of the layout of a TableLayout, with the layout of each 
            TableRow animated as well. Way too fast to see effect well even on Excite 10
            TODO: slow down animation to show effect.

Layouts
  Baseline
    Views/Layouts/Baseline/1. Top          all
        .view.Baseline1
            Use default android:layout_gravity of LinearLayout to place widgets at top 
            of window -- the baseline of the text in the views of differently sized text
            is used to align.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/2. Bottom       all
        .view.Baseline2
            Uses android:layout_gravity="bottom" of LinearLayout to place widgets at 
            bottom of window -- the baseline of the text in the views of differently sized
            text is used to align.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/3. Center       all
        .view.Baseline3
            This example shows that baseline alignment has no effect when the layout 
            gravity is set to center_vertical.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/4. Everywhere   all
        .view.Baseline4
            This example scatters widgets around the window using different values of
            android:layout_gravity

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/5. Multi-line   all
        .view.Baseline6
            Demonstrates the baseline alignment in a RelativeLayout when one of the 
            widgets is a multi-line EditText

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/6. Relative     all
        .view.Baseline7
            Shows alignment in a RelativeLayout using android:layout_alignParentLeft="true"
            and android:layout_alignParentRight="true" for two different TextView widgets.

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 1  --all
        .view.BaselineNested1
            Shows how to use android:baselineAlignedChildIndex to align the baseline of
            widgets contained inside a android:orientation="horizontal" LinearLayout

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 2  --all
        .view.BaselineNested2
            More use of android:baselineAlignedChildIndex to align specific widget inside
            compound nested Views

    Views/Layouts/Baseline/Nested Example 3  --all
        .view.BaselineNested3
            Using android:baselineAlignedChildIndex again this time to point to a linear 
            layout to baseline align by, which in turn will point to a text view inside 
            of it.

  CustomLayout
    Views/Layouts/CustomLayout             all -- v11+ or crashes combineMeasuredStates
        .view.CustomLayoutActivity
            Example of writing a custom layout manager.  This is a fairly full-featured 
            layout manager that is relatively general, handling all layout cases.  The
            custom parameters that it supports are extensions of ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams

  GridLayout
    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/1. Simple Form  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout1
            Demonstrates using GridLayout to build the same "Simple Form" as in the
            LinearLayout and RelativeLayout demos.

    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/2. Form (XML)  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout2
            A form, showing use of the GridLayout API from XML, using a separate layout
            for landscape mode defined in layout-land

    Views/Layouts/GridLayout/3. Form (Java)  --all -- v14+ or crashes GridLayout
        .view.GridLayout3
            A form, showing use of the GridLayout API from java code. Here we demonstrate
            use of the row/column order preserved property which allows rows and or
            columns to pass over each other when needed. The two buttons in the bottom right
            corner need to be separated from the other UI elements. This can either 
            be done by separating rows or separating columns - but we don't need to 
            do both and may only have enough space to do one or the other. Uses
            GridLayout.Spec spec(...) to specify the horizontal and/or vertical
            characteristics of the cells.

  HorizontalScrollView
    Views/Layouts/HorizontalScrollView    all
        .view.HorizontalScrollView1
            Demonstrates horizontal scrolling with a HorizontalScrollView. Needed to set
            android:textSize to see properly.

  LinearLayout
    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/01. Vertical  --all
        .view.LinearLayout1
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The height of the layout is the sum of 
            its children due to android:layout_height="wrap_content"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/02. Vertical (Fill Screen)  --all
        .view.LinearLayout2
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the
            children stacked from the top due to android:layout_height="match_parent"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/03. Vertical (Padded)  --all
        .view.LinearLayout3
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the 
            children stacked from the top. The middle child gets allocated any extra 
            space due to android:layout_weight="1"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/04. Horizontal  --all
        .view.LinearLayout4
            Demonstrates a horizontal linear layout with equally sized columns due to
            all children View's using android:layout_weight="1"

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/05. Simple Form  --all
        .view.LinearLayout5
            Demonstrates building a simple form with nested LinearLayouts. It uses
            a horizontal layout to hold the two buttons at the bottom and uses
            layout_gravity="right". This means the whole horizontal LinearLayout is
            right aligned, not the individual items within it. The horizontal
            LinearLayout's width is set to wrap_content. (If it was match_parent
            it would not have any room to slide to the right.)

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/06. Uniform Size  --all
        .view.LinearLayout6
            LinearLayout which uses a combination of wrap_content on itself and 
            match_parent on all of its children to get every item to be the same width.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/07. Fill Parent  --all
        .view.LinearLayout7
            Demonstrates a horizontal linear layout with equally sized columns. Some 
            columns force their height to match the parent. Does not work as is for some
            reason. Changed the height of the longest text to android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            and it works as advertised.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/08. Gravity  --all
        .view.LinearLayout8
            Demonstrates changing gravity of a LinearLayout programmatically using
            setOrientation(LinearLayout.*) as dictated by options menu choice.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/09. Layout Weight  --all
        .view.LinearLayout9
            Demonstrates a simple linear layout. The layout fills the screen, with the
            children stacked from the top. The ListView receives all the extra space due
            to android:layout_weight="1.0", but because it is still larger than the screen
            it is forced to enter scroll mode.

    Views/Layouts/LinearLayout/10. Background Image  --all
        .view.LinearLayout10
            Demonstrates the use of LinearLayout backgrounds to group labels,
            EditTexts, and buttons, -- OR -- Demonstrates using a LinearLayout
            background to group related TextViews, EditTexts, and Buttons.
            (EditText is hard to read because of background color -- please fix.)
            TODO: Change background or text color so it can be read especially for Excite 10.

  RelativeLayout
    Views/Layouts/RelativeLayout/1. Vertical  --all
        .view.RelativeLayout1
            A simple layout which demonstrates stretching a view to fill the space
            between two other views. This occurs oddly enough because even though all
            three share the same default weight, the android:layout_height="0dip"
            causes the center view to take the leftover space from the parent.

    Views/Layouts/RelativeLayout/2. Simple Form  --all
        .view.RelativeLayout2
            Demonstrates using a relative layout to create a form.

  ScrollView
    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/1. Short      all
        .view.ScrollView1
            Demonstrates wrapping a (short) layout in a ScrollView.

    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/2. Long       all
        .view.ScrollView2
            Demonstrates wrapping a LONG LinearLayout in a ScrollView (All but the first
            TextView and Button in the LinearLayout are Created and .addView'd programmatically)

    Views/Layouts/ScrollView/3. Internal Selection  --all
        .view.InternalSelectionScroll
            Demonstrates how a well behaved view with internal selection InternalSelectionView
            can cause its parent android.widget.ScrollView to scroll to keep the internally
            interesting rectangle on the screen.  InternalSelectionView achieves this by calling
            android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen each time its internal selection changes.
            android.widget.ScrollView, in turn, implements android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen
            thereby acheiving the result.  Note that android.widget.ListView also implements the
            method, so views that call android.view.View#requestRectangleOnScreen that are embedded
            within either android.widget.ScrollView's or android.widget.ListView's can expect to
            keep their internal interesting rectangle visible.  Needs keyboard and a fix to
            background colors in InternalSelectView.java

  TableLayout
    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/01. Basic    all
        .view.TableLayout1
            Very simple example of TableLayout done entirely in xml, three rows, three columns of
            TextViews

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/02. Empty Cells  --all
        .view.TableLayout2
            TableLayout of Button and TextView's showing how to leave a cell empty

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/03. Long Content  --all
        .view.TableLayout3
            Rows have different number of columns and content doesn't fit on screen:
            column 4 of row 2 shrinks all of the other columns android:shrinkColumns="2, 3"
            Oddly enough my test devices are too wide to need shrinking so it does not
            actually show what it intends to show. Not only that, but if the text is too long
            it is wrapped and the row is increased in size to fit the entire text.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/04. Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout4
            Stretch some columns: second column uses android:gravity="right",
            android:stretchColumns="1" (column numbers are zero based)

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/05. Spanning and Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout5
            Uses android:stretchColumns="1" and has View divider line children along with the
            TableRow's

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/06. More Spanning and Stretchable  --all
        .view.TableLayout6
            Uses android:stretchColumns="1" to stretch second column, and android:layout_column="1"
            to skip column 0 for some TableRow's

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/07. Column Collapse  --all
        .view.TableLayout7
            Button's toggle collapsed state of column 0 or column 2, also show how to build a
            TableRow and add it to a TableLayout programmatically

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/08. Toggle Stretch  --all
        .view.TableLayout8
            Uses Button to toggle stretch attribute of one column. Includes programmatically built
            TableRow along with xml TableRows

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/09. Toggle Shrink  --all
        .view.TableLayout9
            Button uses setColumnShrinkable to toggle the shrinkColumns attribute of a table which
            has a column so long it forces the last columns off the screen.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/10. Simple Form  --all
        .view.TableLayout10
            Uses xml only to construct a form, too long of an entry in the EditText boxes does a
            wierd thing -- it scrolls the buttons at the bottom off the screen!
            TODO: Scroll the EditText boxes instead.

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/11. Gravity  --all
        .view.TableLayout11
            Shows difference in layout for android:gravity="right",
            android:layout_gravity="center_horizontal" and
            android:layout_gravity="right|bottom" (large cell height is set by
            a "strut" of 68dp for the right|bottom example row.)

    Views/Layouts/TableLayout/12. Cell Spanning  --all
        .view.TableLayout12
            Creates large multi-column cells for several rows using android:layout_span=

Lists
    Views/Lists/01. Array                  all
        .view.List1
            Uses an ArrayAdapter<String> to fill a ListActivity's list

    Views/Lists/02. Cursor (People)        all
        .view.List2
            Builds a cursor using getContentResolver().query(...) of the Contacts provider for a
            projection of Contacts._ID, and Contacts.DISPLAY_NAME and sets it as the ListAdapter

    Views/Lists/03. Cursor (Phones)        all
        .view.List3
            A list view example where the data comes from a cursor, and a SimpleCursorListAdapter
            is used to map each item to a two-line display.

    Views/Lists/04. ListAdapter            all
        .view.List4
            A list view example where the data comes from a custom ListAdapter which displays from
            an array of strings using a custom view (reusing recycled views when one is given to it.)

    Views/Lists/05. Separators             all
        .view.List5
            A list view example with separators. Separators are implemented by overriding the methods
            areAllItemsEnabled, and isEnabled

    Views/Lists/06. ListAdapter Collapsed  --all
        .view.List6
            A list view example where the data comes from a custom ListAdapter, onListItemClick is
            overridden to "toggle" the view between two states: collapsed to a title, and expanded
            to a title and text for that title

    Views/Lists/07. Cursor (Phones)        all
        .view.List7
            A list view example where the data comes from a cursor. Original used the "selected"
            item in list to display the details of an item at the bottom of the string by implementing
            OnItemSelectedListener, I modified to do the same when onListItemClick is called since
            a touch interface cannot select.

    Views/Lists/08. Photos                 all
        .view.List8
            A list view that demonstrates the use of setEmptyView. This example also uses a custom
            layout file that adds some extra buttons to the screen instead of using the ListActivity
            default layout.

    Views/Lists/09. Array (Overlay)        all
        .view.List9
            Another variation of the list of cheeses. In this case, we use
            AbsListView#setOnScrollListener(AbsListView.OnScrollListener)
            AbsListView#setOnItemScrollListener(AbsListView.OnItemScrollListener)
            to display the first letter of the visible range of cheeses. Uses an
            Handler thread to remove the dialog displaying the letter after 3000ms
            using postDelayed(mRemoveWindow, 3000); where mRemoveWindow is a pointer
            to a class RemoveWindow which implements Runnable. (Cute -- need to use this)

    Views/Lists/10. Single choice list     all
        .view.List10
            This example shows how to use choice mode on a list. This list is in
            CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE mode, which means the items behave like radio-buttons.

    Views/Lists/11. Multiple choice list   all
        .view.List11
            This example shows how to use choice mode on a list. This list is in
            CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE mode, which means the items behave like checkboxes.

    Views/Lists/12. Transcript             all
        .view.List12
            Demonstrates the using a list view in transcript mode. The bottom of the layout
            is an EditText, clicking on the EditText view .add()'s  the text to the
            ArrayAdapter filling the ListView above it.

    Views/Lists/13. Slow Adapter           all
        .view.List13
            Demonstrates how a list can avoid expensive operations during scrolls or flings.
            In this case, we pretend that binding a view to its data is slow (even though it
            really isn't). When a scroll/fling is happening, the adapter binds the view to
            temporary data. After the scroll/fling has finished, the temporary data is
            replaced with the actual data. Usable approach but needs major modification to
            use in real world application.

    Views/Lists/14. Efficient Adapter      all
        .view.List14
            Demonstrates how to write an efficient list adapter. The adapter used in this example
            binds to an ImageView and to a TextView for each row in the list.
            To work efficiently the adapter implemented here uses two techniques:
            - It reuses the convertView passed to getView() to avoid inflating View
              when it is not necessary
            - It uses the ViewHolder pattern to avoid calling findViewById()
              when it is not necessary
            The ViewHolder pattern consists in storing a data structure in the tag of the view
            returned by getView(). This data structure contains references to the views we want
            to bind data to, thus avoiding calls to findViewById() every time getView() is invoked.
            Note: uses mInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_icon_text, parent, false) instead of
            mInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item_icon_text, null)
            TODO: Fix all other inflate() with null rootview.

            This demo illustrates the use of CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE_MODAL, a.k.a. selection
            mode on ListView couple with the new simple_list_item_activated_1 which uses
            a highlighted border for selected items.

    Views/Lists/17. Activate items         all -- v11+ or crash
        .view.List17
            A ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE list view where the last item the user
            clicked is placed in the "activated" state, causing its background to
            highlight. Uses the built-in layout android.R.layout.simple_list_item_activated_1
            for showing a list item with a single line of text whose background
            changes when activated. Uses getListView().setItemChecked in onCreate
            to start with first item activated.

Popup Menu
    Views/Popup Menu                       all -- v11+ or crash
        .view.PopupMenu1
            This demonstrates the use of the PopupMenu class. Clicking the button will
            inflate and show a popup menu from an XML resource.

Progress Bar
    Views/Progress Bar/1. Incremental      all
        .view.ProgressBar1
            Demonstrates how to use ProgressBar as a widget. The ProgressBar is defined in
            the layout xml file to use style="?android:attr/progressBarStyleHorizontal",
            android:layout_width="200dip", android:layout_height="wrap_content",
            android:max="100". It uses android:progress="50" to initialize the state of
            the default progress and android:secondaryProgress="75" to initialize the state
            of the secondary progress. Buttons below the ProgressBar decrement or increment
            the two progresss states. In spite of the comments in the code, the progress bar
            does not appear in the title bar, it appears at the top of the LinearLayout

    Views/Progress Bar/2. Smooth           all
        .view.ProgressBar2
            Demonstrates the use of indeterminate progress bars as widgets and in the
            window's title bar. The widgets show the 3 different sizes of circular
            progress bars that can be used. The window title bar does not work, it has
            been dropped as of Android 5.0 appCompat library.

    Views/Progress Bar/3. Dialogs          all
        .view.ProgressBar3
            Demonstrates the use of progress dialogs.  Uses Activity#onCreateDialog
             Activity#showDialog to ensure the dialogs will be properly saved and
             restored. Buttons on the main Layout allow you to choose between one
             which sets the title using dialog.setTitle("Indeterminate") and one which
             has no title. (Direct use of showDialog is deprecated, use a DialogFragment
             instead. TODO: convert to use DialogFragment

Radio Group
    Views/Radio Group                      all
        .view.RadioGroup1
            Demonstrates RadioGroup, including adding a RadioButton to an xml defined
            RadioGroup programmatically (the R.id.snack is created in the file values/ids.xml),
            retrieving the R.id.* of the RadioButton selected, clearing all buttons, and the
            value View.NO_ID (=-1) returned when no RadioButton is selected.

Rating Bar
    Views/Rating Bar                       all
        .view.RatingBar1
            Demonstrates how to use a rating bar. The top two RatingBar's have their
            RatingBar.OnRatingBarChangeListener set to this and a onRatingChanged method
            updates a TextView and two RatingBar indicators based on the values passed to
            it.

Rotating Button
    Views/Rotating Button                 all -- v11+ or crash
        .view.RotatingButton
            This application demonstrates the ability to transform views in 2D and 3D,
            scaling them, translating them, and rotating them (in 2D and 3D). Use the
            seek bars to set the various transform properties of the button. It sets the
            SeekBar.OnSeekBarChangeListener of each SeekBar to morph the button using
            setTranslationX, setTranslationY, setScaleX, setScaleY, setRotationX, setRotationY,

            This demonstrates the usage of SearchView in an ActionBar as a menu item. It sets
            a SearchableInfo on the SearchView for suggestions and submitting queries to. In
            AndroidManifest.xml a <meta-data> element android:name="android.app.default_searchable"
            android:value=".app.SearchQueryResults" sets the Activity to handle search requests.

Secure View
    Views/Secure View                      all -- v9+ or crash
        .view.SecureView
            This activity demonstrates two different ways in which views can be made more secure to
            touch spoofing attacks by leveraging framework features.

            The activity presents 3 buttons that ostensibly perform a risky security critical
            function.  Under ordinary circumstances, the user would never click on these buttons
            or would at least think long and hard about it.  However, a carefully crafted toast can
            overlay the contents of the activity in such a way as to make the user believe the buttons
            are innocuous.  Since the toast cannot receive input, the touches are passed down to the
            activity potentially yielding an effect other than what the user intended.

            To simulate the spoofing risk, this activity pops up a specially crafted overlay as
            a toast lay-ed out so as to cover the buttons and part of the descriptive text.
            For the purposes of this demonstration, pretend that the overlay was actually popped
            up by a malicious application published by the International Cabal of Evil Penguins.

            The 3 buttons are set up as follows:

            1. The "unsecured button" does not apply any touch filtering of any kind.
               When the toast appears, this button remains clickable as usual which creates an
               opportunity for spoofing to occur.

            2. The "built-in secured button" leverages the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured view
               attribute to ask the framework to filter out touches when the window is obscured.
               When the toast appears, the button does not receive the touch and appears to be inoperable.

            3. The "custom secured button" adds a touch listener to the button which intercepts the
               touch event and checks whether the window is obscured.  If so, it warns the user and
               drops the touch event.  This example is intended to demonstrate how a view can
               perform its own filtering and provide additional feedback by examining the MotionEvent
               flags to determine whether the window is obscured.  Here we use a touch listener but
               a custom view subclass could perform the filtering by overriding
               View#onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent).

Seek Bar
    Views/Seek Bar                         all
        .view.SeekBar1
            Demonstrates how to use a seek bar. It implements SeekBar.OnSeekBarChangeListener which
            has the three call backs: onProgressChanged, onStartTrackingTouch, and onStopTrackingTouch
            displaying appropriate text based on the information passed it.
            TODO: why do first two SeekBar's start out enabled in spite of android:enabled="false"

Spinner
    Views/Spinner                          all
        .view.Spinner1
            Demonstrates the use of the Spinner widget. It creates ArrayAdapter<CharSequence>'s
            from string-array resources and setDropDownViewResource to set the view used by the
            adapter to create drop down views, then uses setAdapter to set the adapter used by
            each Spinner. setOnItemSelectedListener is used to set an OnItemSelectedListener
            for each which involves implementing onItemSelected and onNothingSelected to receive
            callbacks when an item in the Spinner's is selected.

Splitting Touches across Views
    Views/Splitting Touches across Views   all - v11+ or crash in layout
        .view.SplitTouchView
            This activity demonstrates splitting touch events across multiple views within a
            view group.  Here we have two ListViews within a LinearLayout that has the attribute
            android:splitMotionEvents set to "true". Try scrolling both lists simultaneously
            using multiple fingers.

Switches
    Views/Switches                         all - v14+ or crash in layout

System UI Visibility
    Views/System UI Visibility/Content Browser  -- v16
        .view.ContentBrowserActivity
            This activity demonstrates how to use system UI flags to implement
            a content browser style of UI (such as a book reader). Includes "Content",
            and implementation of a view for displaying immersive content, using system
            UI flags to transition in and out of modes where the user is focused on
            that content. When the user clicks, it toggles the visibility of navigation
            elements.

    Views/System UI Visibility/Content Browser Nav Bar  -- v19
        .view.ContentBrowserNavActivity
            This activity demonstrates how to use system UI flags to implement a content
            browser style of UI (such as a book reader) that hides the nav bar as well as
            the status bar. The difference is the addition of the flags
            SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION, and SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE.

    Views/System UI Visibility/Game        v19
        .view.GameActivity
            This activity demonstrates how to use the system UI flags to implement
            an immersive game.

    Views/System UI Visibility/System UI Modes  -- v18
        .view.SystemUIModes
            This activity demonstrates some of the available ways to reduce the size or
            visual contrast of the system decor, in order to better focus the user's
            attention or use available screen real estate on the task at hand. Uses
            CheckBox'es to set or unset the various flags passed to View.setSystemUiVisibility
            for the IV extends ImageView which serves as the background in the FrameLayout
            holding it and the CheckBox'es which are overlay it.

    Views/System UI Visibility/System UI Modes Overlay  -- v16
        .view.SystemUIModesOverlay
            Extend .view.SystemUIModes with the addition of requesting the window feature
            Window.FEATURE_ACTION_BAR_OVERLAY which overlays the action bar rather than
            positioning the action bar in the space above the window content.

    Views/System UI Visibility/Translucent Bars  -- v19
        .view.TranslucentBarsActivity
            Layout sets the attribute android:fitsSystemWindows="true" to adjust view layout
            based on system windows such as the status bar. When true, it  adjusts the padding
            of the view to leave space for the system windows. Will only take effect if this
            view is in a non-embedded activity. This has the effect of allowing the text
            displayed to be visible below the system navigation bar and notification bar.
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Holo.NoActionBar.TranslucentDecor" is set in
            AndroidManifest to make the bars translucent.

    Views/System UI Visibility/Video Player  -- v16
        .view.VideoPlayerActivity
            Implementation of a view for displaying full-screen video playback, using system
            UI flags to transition in and out of modes where the entire screen can be filled
            with content (at the expense of no user interaction).

Tabs
    Views/Tabs/1. Content By Id            all
        .view.Tabs1
            An example of an TabActivity that uses labels TabSpec#setIndicator(CharSequence)
            for its indicators and views by id from a layout file TabSpec#setContent(int).
            TextView's sharing a FrameLayout are selected by the tabs.

    Views/Tabs/2. Content By Factory       all
        .view.Tabs2
            Example of using a tab content factory for the content via
            TabHost.TabSpec#setContent(android.widget.TabHost.TabContentFactory)
            It also demonstrates using an icon on one of the tabs via
            TabHost.TabSpec#setIndicator(CharSequence, android.graphics.drawable.Drawable)
            but this does not work using the default Theme as of Ice Cream Sandwich.

    Views/Tabs/3. Content By Intent        all
        .view.Tabs3
            An example of tab content that launches an activity via
            android.widget.TabHost.TabSpec#setContent(android.content.Intent), the
            three tabs launch .view.List1, .view.List8, and .view.Controls1
            respectively, using Intent's. The last sets the Intent flag so that it is
            recreated each time the tab is clicked using:
            Intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP)

    Views/Tabs/4. Non Holo theme           all
        .view.Tabs4
            Identical to Tabs2. The change is in the theme used in the manifest file:
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme" The Icon shows up now unlike Tabs2.

    Views/Tabs/5. Scrollable               all
        .view.Tabs5
            Demonstrates the Tab scrolling when too many tabs are displayed to fit
            in the screen. In the layout a HorizontalScrollView contains the TabWidget
            and 30 tabs are added to it using Tabhost.addTab (TabHost.TabSpec tabSpec)
            the callback createTabContent creates the content as each tab is selected.

    Views/Tabs/6. Right aligned            all
        .view.Tabs6
            Uses a right gravity for the TabWidget. Does not seem to have any effect even
            after changing AndroidManifest to android:theme="@android:style/Theme"

Text
    Views/Text/EditText
        .view.EditTextDemo
            Demonstrates the android.widget.EditText widget. android:imeOptions="actionSearch"
            only produces an action key in landscape orientation for some reason. (No :id?)

    Views/Text/Linkify                           all
        .text.Link
            Four different ways to generate html like links and styled text: text1 shows
            the android:autoLink property, which automatically creates links for things
            like URLs and phone numbers found in the text. No java code is needed to make
            this work; text2 has links specified by putting <a> tags in the string resource.
            By default these links will appear but not respond to user input. To make
            them active, you need to call setMovementMethod() on the TextView object;
            text3 shows creating text with links from HTML in the Java code, rather than
            from a string resource.  Note that for a fixed string, using a (localizable)
            resource as shown above is usually a better way to go, this example is
            intended to illustrate how you might display text that came from a dynamic
            source (eg, the network); text4 illustrates constructing a styled string
            containing a link without using HTML at all.  Again, for a fixed string you
            should probably be using a string resource, not a hardcoded value.

    Views/Text/LogTextBox                        all
        .text.LogTextBox1
            Using a LogTextBox to display a scrollable text area to which text is
            appended. LogTextBox.java is a custom TextView that is Editable and by
            default scrollable, like EditText without a cursor.

    Views/Text/Marquee                           all
        .text.Marquee
            Need to add android:focusable="true" and android:focusableInTouchMode="true"
            to each of the buttons in order for the Marquee animations to run.

    Views/Text/TextClock                        all - v17+ or crash
        .view.TextClockDemo
            Variants of TextClock: Default formats; Shows the date only; Uses styles
            (different android:format12Hour, and android:format24Hour strings with
            font and face defined in string xml); Shows seconds; Uses a fixed time zone.

    Views/Text/TextSwitcher                     all
        .view.TextSwitcher1
            Uses a TextSwitcher to animate changes in the View controlled by the TextSwitcher.
            Two TextView's are requested from the app's overriding of ViewSwitcher.ViewFactory
            method makeView, and when the View needs to be updated TextSwitcher.setText is
            called to change the text and animate to it.

    Views/Text/TextView
        .view.TextViewDemo
            Demonstrates the android.widget.TextView widget. Shows different values for
            android:textAppearance: ?android:attr/textAppearanceSmall,
            ?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium, and ?android:attr/textAppearanceLarge,
            as well as the effect of android:textIsSelectable="true",
            android:visibility="invisible", and android:background="#ff00ff00"
