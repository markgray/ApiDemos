     * UI. Next we add 4 tabs configured to launch 4 different (eventually) [Fragment] classes. In
     * each case our procedure consists of using `bar.newTab()` to create a new [ActionBar.Tab], set
     * the text of the new tab to a title appropriate for the [Fragment] the tab will control, set
     * the [TabListener] of the tab to a new instance of our class `TabListener<>` with the arguments
     * to the constructor of the `TabListener<>` chosen to give a unique tag String and [Fragment]
     * class, and then we add the tab to the `bar` (the tab is not included in the action bar until
     * it is added). (The code for adding the 4 tabs is identical except for the arguments passed to
     * the methods used so I will spare you the details.)
