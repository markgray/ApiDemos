     * `String prefix`, and that label has no further "/" characters (in this case the remaining
     * leaf of its label is stored under the key "title" and an `Intent` to launch that activity
     * is stored under the key "intent"). For all labels which begin with `prefix` but whose
     * label still has one or more following "/" characters, a single entry for all of them is created
     * whose "title" is the next segment in their label and whose "intent" is an `Intent` created
     * by our method `browseIntent` to relaunch this `ApiDemos` activity with the extra
     * "com.example.android.apis.Path" used to store the next value of `String prefix` for its
     * `onCreate` method to use when calling us to create the data used by its adapter.
     * (Very clever! Needs careful explanation).
     *
     * First we initialize our variable `List<Map<String, Object>> myData` with an instance of
     * `ArrayList` (this is the list we will return to our caller). We initialize our variable
     * `Intent mainIntent` with an intent with the action ACTION_MAIN (Start as a main entry
     * point, does not expect to receive data) and a null uri, and add the category CATEGORY_SAMPLE_CODE
     * (To be used as a sample code example (not part of the normal user experience)). We initialize
     * our variable `PackageManager pm` with a `PackageManager` instance for finding global
     * package information, then retrieve all activities that can be performed for `mainIntent`
     * (that is all activities performing the action ACTION_MAIN and with the category CATEGORY_SAMPLE_CODE)
     * saving the results in `List<ResolveInfo> list`. If `list` is null we return `myData`
     * to the caller.
     *
     * We declare `String[] prefixPath`, and set our variable `String prefixWithSlash` to
     * our parameter `prefix`. If `prefix` is equal to "" (the empty string, as it will be
     * at the beginning of our app) we set `prefixPath` to null, otherwise we split `prefixPath`
     * on the "/" character saving the results in `String[] prefixPath`, and set `prefixWithSlash`
     * to the string formed by adding an "/" to the end of `prefix`.
     *
     * We initialize `int len` to the length of `List<ResolveInfo> list`, and create a new
     * instance of `HashMap` to initialize our  variable `Map<String, Boolean> entries`.
     * We now loop over `int i` for the `len` `ResolveInfo` objects in `list`.
     * We initialize `ResolveInfo info` with the entry at `i` in `list`, then use
     * `pm` to load the label of `info` into our variable `CharSequence labelSeq`.
     * If `labelSeq` is not null, we initialize `String label` to the string value of
     * `labelSeq`, or if it is null we use the `name` field of the `activityInfo`
     * field of `info` to initialize `label`.
     *
     * If the length of `prefixWithSlash` is 0, or `label` starts with the string
     * `prefixWithSlash` we have found an activity we want to process further. We split
     * `label` on the "/" character and save the results in `String[] labelPath`. If
     * `prefixPath` is equal to null, we initialize `String nextLabel` to the contents
     * of `labelPath[0]` (this happens the first time `onCreate` calls us), otherwise
     * we initialize it to the contents of `labelPath[ prefixPath.length ]` (the path segment in
     * the activities label which follows `prefixPath`).
     *
     * If our `prefixPath` array is one shorter than our `labelPath` array (we have found
     * a leaf "node" activity with no further segments in its path) we call our method `addItem`
     * to add a `Map<String, Object>` to `myData` with `nextLabel` stored under the
     * key "label", and an `Intent` stored under the key "intent" which we create using our method
     * `activityIntent` from the `packageName` field of the `applicationInfo` field
     * of the `activityInfo` field of `info` for the name of the package implementing the
     * desired component, and the `name` field of the `activityInfo` field of `info`
     * for the name of the class inside of the application package that will be used for the Intent.
     *
     * If there are more than one segments left in the `labelPath` array path compared to the
     * `prefixPath` array we first check to see if our map `entries` is null, skipping this
     * activity if it is not null (previous activities shared our "path" prefix). If it is null this
     * is the first of possibly several more which share this "path" prefix, so we call our method
     * `addItem` to add a `Map<String, Object>` to `myData` with `nextLabel`
     * stored under the "label" key and stored under the "intent" key will be an intent created by our
     * method `browseIntent` using the path string of `nextLabel` if `prefix` is
     * equal to the empty string "", or the string formed by concatenating `prefix` to a "/"
     * character followed by `nextLabel` if `prefix` is not equal to "" (`browseIntent`
     * creates an intent which launches this `ApiDemos` activity again only with an extra stored
     * under the key "com.example.android.apis.Path" which contains its argument `String path`).
     * Finally we store true under the `nextLabel` key in our map `entries` so we will skip
     * duplicate list entries for activities which share this sub-path, and then we loop back to process
     * the next `ResolveInfo` object in `list`.
     *
     * After processing all of `list` we sort `myData` using our `Comparator`
     * `sDisplayNameComparator` and return `myData` to our caller.
     *
     * @param prefix Prefix string to use to filter entries to those our caller is interested in
     * @return List of `Map<String, Object>` of all the activities in our manifest which have
     * action ACTION_MAIN, and category CATEGORY_SAMPLE_CODE, and whose label begins with our parameter
     * `String prefix`. The next "path segment" is stored under the key "title" and an appropriate
     * `Intent` to deal with it is stored under the key "intent".
