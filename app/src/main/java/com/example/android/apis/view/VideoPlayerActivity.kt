         *  "low profile" mode. In low profile mode, the status bar and/or navigation icons
         *  may dim.
         *

         *  so that its content can take over the screen while still allowing the user to
         *  interact with the application.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION - View requests that the system navigation be
         *  temporarily hidden.
         *
         * Then if [visible] is true, we initialize `Handler` variable `val h` with a handler
