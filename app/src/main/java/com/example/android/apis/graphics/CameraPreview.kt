         * Calculates and returns the size from the list of supported preview sizes for this camera
         * which will make optimal use of the screen space we have available. If our parameter [sizes]
         * is *null*, we return *null* having done nothing. Otherwise we define ASPECT_TOLERANCE to
         * be 0.1, this is used to search the supported preview sizes for a size whose aspect ratio
         * is closest to that defined by our parameters [w] and [h]. We calculate this target aspect
         * ratio `val targetRatio` to be the [Double] of `w/h`. We initialize [Camera.Size] variable
         * `var optimalSize` to *null*, [Double] variable `var minDiff` to be the largest positive
         * finite value of type [Double].
         *
         * Now in order to find a [Camera.Size] in `List<Size> sizes` which most closely matches our
         * window's aspect ratio, we loop through all the `size`'s in `List<Size> sizes`, calculate
         * its [Double] `val ratio` aspect ratio by dividing its `size.width` field by its
         * `size.height` field, and if the absolute difference between `ratio` and `targetRatio` is
         * greater than ASPECT_TOLERANCE we skip it. Otherwise if the absolute difference between
         * the `size.height` and our [h] parmeter is less than the current value of `minDiff` we set
         * `optimalSize` to `size` and update `minDiff` to be the absolute difference between the
         * `size.height` and our [h] parameter.
         *
         * If this loop failed to find a best match for the aspect ratio (`optimalSize` is still
         * *null*) we search `List<Size> sizes` for a [Camera.Size] whose field `height` is closest
         * to [h] and set `optimalSize` to it.
         *
         * In either case we return `optimalSize` to the caller.
