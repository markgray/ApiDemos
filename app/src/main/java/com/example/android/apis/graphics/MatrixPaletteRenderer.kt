         * byte order, which we use to initialize our `CharBuffer` field `mIndexBuffer` by viewing

         * to the "top" using the index `y`, and in an inner loop we loop from the "left" to the
         * "right" using the index `x`. Then for each of these quadrilaterals we calculate the
         * vertex index values for the quadrilateral:

     * Called when the surface is created or recreated. Called when the rendering thread starts and
     * whenever the EGL context is lost. The EGL context will typically be lost when the Android
     * device awakes after going to sleep.
     *
     * First we disable the server-side GL capability GL_DITHER (color components or indices will not
     * be dithered before they are written to the color buffer). We specify the implementation-specific
     * hint GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT to be GL_FASTEST (Indicates the quality of color, texture
     * coordinate, and fog coordinate interpolation to be a simple linear interpolation of colors
     * and/or texture coordinates). We set the clear color to gray, the shade model to GL_SMOOTH
     * (causes the computed colors of vertices to be interpolated as the primitive is rasterized,
     * typically assigning different colors to each resulting pixel fragment). We enable the server
     * side GL capability GL_DEPTH_TEST (do depth comparisons and update the depth buffer) and the
     * server-side GL capability GL_TEXTURE_2D (if no fragment shader is active, two-dimensional
     * texturing is performed). Next we allocate [Int] array `val textures` to hold one int and ask
     * GL to generate one texture name in it, and we set our field [mTextureID] to that texture name,
     * then bind that named texture to the texturing target GL_TEXTURE_2D (while a texture is bound,
     * GL operations on the target to which it is bound affect the bound texture, and queries of the
     * target to which it is bound return state from the bound texture. If texture mapping is active
     * on the target to which a texture is bound, the bound texture is used. In effect, the texture
     * targets become aliases for the textures currently bound to them, and the texture name zero
     * refers to the default textures that were bound to them at initialization).
     *
     * Next we set texture parameter GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER for GL_TEXTURE_2D to be GL_NEAREST (The
     * texture minifying function is used whenever the pixel being textured maps to an area greater
     * than one texture element. GL_NEAREST Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest
     * (in Manhattan distance) to the center of the pixel being textured). We set texture parameter
     * GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER for GL_TEXTURE_2D to be GL_LINEAR (The GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER function
     * is used when the pixel being textured maps to an area less than or equal to one texture
     * element. GL_LINEAR Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
     * to the center of the pixel being textured).
     *
     * We set texture parameter GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S for GL_TEXTURE_2D to be GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE (Sets the
     * wrap parameter for texture coordinate *s* to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE which causes *s* coordinates to
     * be clamped to the range [1/2N, 1-1/2N] where N is the size of the texture in the direction of
     * clamping), and we set texture parameter GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T for GL_TEXTURE_2D to be GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
     * as well. This has textures stop at the last pixel when you fall off the edge in either direction.
     *
     * We next set texture environment parameter GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE of GL_TEXTURE_ENV to GL_REPLACE
     * (causes the texture to replace whatever pixels were present).
     *
     * We open our raw resource file robot.png for reading by [InputStream] `val inputStream` and
     * decode the png into [Bitmap] `val bitmap` (with the code wrapped in an appropriate try block).
     * We then specify `bitmap` as a two-dimensional texture image for GL_TEXTURE_2D, and recycle
     * `bitmap`.
     *
     * Finally we initialize our [Grid] field [mGrid] with the [Grid] generated by our method
     * [generateWeightedGrid].

     * the color buffer and depth buffer, enable the server-side GL capability GL_DEPTH_TEST, and
     * the server-side GL capability GL_CULL_FACE.
     *
     * Now we are ready to draw, so we set the matrix mode to GL_MODELVIEW and load it with the
     * identity matrix, and then we define a viewing transformation with the position of the eye
     * point at (0,0,-5), the position of the reference point at (0,0,0), and the direction of the
     * up vector (0,1,0).
     *
     * We enable the client-side capability GL_VERTEX_ARRAY (the vertex array is enabled for writing
     * and used during rendering), and the client-side capability GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY (the texture
     * coordinate array is enabled for writing and used during rendering).
     *
     * We select active texture unit GL_TEXTURE0, and bind [mTextureID] to the texturing target
     * GL_TEXTURE_2D. We set the texture parameter GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S of GL_TEXTURE_2D to GL_REPEAT
     * (Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate *s* to ignore the integer part of the *s*
     * coordinate and use only the fractional part, thereby creating a repeating pattern), and
     * GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T to GL_REPEAT as well.
     *
     * We set [Long] variable `val time` to the number of milliseconds since boot modulo 4000, set
     * the [Double] variable `val animationUnit` to `time/4000` in order to calculate a value for
     * the [Float] variable `val unitAngle` which we multiply by 135.0 to get the current value for
     * the [Float] variable `val angle` which we will later use to build and apply a rotation matrix
     * to the GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_OES matrix (vertices will transformed by the matrix before they are
     * rendered, a "skinning effect". Skinning allows organic shapes (such as humans) to deform nicely
     * around joints as they bend. Without skinning, joints have a rigid appearance that is more
     * similar to a mechanical joint like you would see in a robot.)
     *
     * We enable the server side capability GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_OES (When this extension is utilized,
     * the enabled units transform each vertex by the modelview matrices specified by the vertices'
     * respective indices. These results are subsequently scaled by the weights of the respective
     * units and then summed to create the eye-space vertex i.e. it warps the vertex location before
     * they are rendered to the eye-space). We set the current matrix mode to GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_OES
     * (GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_OES matrix stack is the target for subsequent matrix operations), set the
     * current matrix palette to 0, and load the current palette matrix from the modelview matrix.
     * We then multiply the matrix by a rotation matrix of `angle` around the z axis.
     *
     * Next we set the current matrix palette to 1, and load the current palette matrix from the
     * modelview matrix. Each vertex contains a weight for the two palette matrices, with the vertices
     * at the bottom of the column giving less weight to palette 0 (the rotated model view) with the
     * rest given to palette 1 so palette 1 (the un-rotated matrix) has more influence at the bottom
     * and palette 0 (the rotated matrix) has more influence at the top causing the bottom to be
     * glued in place and the top to sway with the `angle` of rotation.
     *
     * Now that we have set up our texture and palette configuration we call the [Grid.draw] method
     * of [mGrid] to draw the vertices of [mGrid]. And finally we disable the server-side capability
     * GL_MATRIX_PALETTE_OES.

     * (the weight of palette matrix 0) is assigned the value of the index `j` divided by the
     * number of `vSteps` (it runs from a weight of 0 at the bottom of the tower (no effect),
     * to 1.0 at the top of the tower (maximum effect), and `val w1` is just `1-w0` (it runs
     * from a weight of 1.0 at the bottom of the tower (maximum effect) to a weight of 0 at the top
     * of the tower (no effect). The last statement of our double loop calls the method `grid.set`
     * to store in the space reserved for the index `(i,j)` the location of the vertex (x,y,z),
     * its texture coordinate assignment (u,v), the weights of the two palette matrices `w0`
     * and `w1` and the indices of these matrices 0 and 1 (in kotlin this is done using matrix
     * notation -- cute hey?).
     *
     * When our loops have finished building our tower [Grid] `grid` we call the
     * [Grid.createBufferObjects] method of `grid.` to load the information contained in its
     * [Grid.mVertexBuffer] and [Grid.mIndexBuffer] into the openGL buffer object data store.
     *
     * And finally we return `grid` to our caller (the `onSurfaceCreated` method, which
     * stores it in [Grid] field [mGrid]).
     *
     * @param gl the [GL] interface.
     * @return A [Grid] ready to be drawn, with (x,y,z) vertex coordinates, (u,v) texture
     * coordinates, weights and indices of the two palette matrices used all loaded into the openGL
     * vertex buffer.
