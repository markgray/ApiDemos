/**
 * Secure Dialog Activity
 *
 * This activity demonstrates how to create a dialog whose window is backed by
 * a secure surface using [WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_SECURE].
 * Because the surface is secure, its contents cannot be captured in screenshots
 * and will not be visible on non-secure displays even when mirrored.
 *
 * Here are a few things you can do to experiment with secure surfaces and
 * observe their behavior:
 *  - Try taking a screenshot. Either the system will prevent you from taking
 * a screenshot altogether or the screenshot should not contain the contents
 * of the secure surface.
 *  - Try mirroring the secure surface onto a non-secure display such as an
 * "Overlay Display" created using the "Simulate secondary displays" option in
 * the "Developer options" section of the Settings application. The non-secure
 * secondary display should not show the contents of the secure surface.
 *  - Try mirroring the secure surface onto a secure display such as an HDMI
 * display with HDCP enabled. The contents of the secure surface should appear
 * on the display.
