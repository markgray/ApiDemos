     * that the data that we read from our [JobParameters] parameter [params] suggest that to properly
     * list the content changes will require a rescan of the photos, in which case we append the string
     * "Photos rescan needed!" to `sb`). If the list of URIs that have triggered the job returned by
     * the `getTriggeredContentUris` method of [params] is not *null* we want to iterate through
     * them and collect either the ids that were impacted or note that a generic change has happened,

     * [Uri] `uri` in the list of URIs that have triggered the job returned by the `getTriggeredContentUris`
     * method of [params] we initialize `MutableList<String>` variable `val path` with the decoded
     * path segments of `uri`, each without a leading or trailing '/'. If `path` is not *null* and
     * its size is one more than the size of EXTERNAL_PATH_SEGMENTS then the last entry in `path` is
     * a filename so we add that last entry to our list `ids`, otherwise there is some general
     * change in the photos so we set `rescanNeeded` to true.
     *
     * When done processing the changed URIs in [params], we check if the size of `ids` is greater
     * than 0 (we found some ids that changed), and if so we proceed to determine what they are.
     * To do this we initialize [StringBuilder] variable `val selection` with a new instance then
     * loop over `i` for all the entries in `ids` first appending the string " OR " to `selection`
     * following every selection clause in `selection` (by skipping doing this if `selection` is not
     * empty). We then append the string "_id" followed by the string "='" followed by the `i`'th
     * entry in `ids` followed by the string "'" (forming a selection query like _id='88').
     *
     * When done forming our selection string in `selection` we initialize [Cursor] variable
     * `var cursor` to *null* and [Boolean] `var haveFiles` to *false*. Then wrapped in a try block
     * intended to catch [SecurityException], and whose finally block closes [Cursor] `cursor` if it
     * is not *null* we:
     *
     *  * We use a `ContentResolver` instance for our application's package to query the URI
     *  EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI ("content://media/external/images/media") for the projection
     *  PROJECTION (the _ID and DATA columns) with the selection consisting of the string
     *  value of `selection` with *null* for the selection arguments and *null* for the sort
     *  order saving the [Cursor] returned in `cursor`.
     *  * We now loop while the `moveToNext` method of `cursor` returns *true* when moving to
     *  the next row (*false* is returned if it is past the last entry). We initialize [String]
     *  variable `val dir` by retrieving the string in column PROJECTION_DATA of `cursor`. If
     *  `dir` starts with the string DCIM_DIR, we check if `haveFiles` is *false* (first time
     *  through) and if so we set it to *true* and append the string "New photos:\n" to `sb`.
     *  Then we append the string value of the int in column PROJECTION_ID of `cursor` to `sb`,
     *  followed by the string ": ", followed by `dir` followed by a newline, then loop back
     *  for the next row.
     *
     * After adding any filenames that have changed to `sb`, or adding text to the effect that
     * we did not find any we toast the string value of `sb`, then add a delayed execution of
     * [Runnable] field [mWorker] to the queue of [Handler] field [mHandler], and finally we
