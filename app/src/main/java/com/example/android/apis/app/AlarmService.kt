/**
 * This demonstrates how you can schedule an alarm that causes a service to
 * be started. This is useful when you want to schedule alarms that initiate
 * long-running operations, such as retrieving recent e-mails.
 *
 * Note: as of API 19, all repeating alarms are inexact. If your application needs
 * precise delivery times then it must use one-time exact alarms, rescheduling each
 * time. Legacy applications whose targetSdkVersion is earlier than API 19 will
 * continue to have all of their alarms, including repeating alarms, treated as exact.
