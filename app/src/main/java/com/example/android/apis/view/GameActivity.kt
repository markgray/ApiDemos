         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_FULLSCREEN - our View would like its window to be laid out
         *  as if it has requested SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN, even if it currently hasn't.
         *  This allows it to avoid artifacts when switching in and out of that mode, at the
         *  expense that some of its user interface may be covered by screen decorations
         *  when they are shown.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_HIDE_NAVIGATION - our View would like its window to be laid
         *  out as if it has requested SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION, even if it currently
         *  hasn't. This allows it to avoid artifacts when switching in and out of that mode,
         *  at the expense that some of its user interface may be covered by screen decorations
         *  when they are shown.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LAYOUT_STABLE - When using other layout flags, we would like a stable
         *  view of the content insets given to fitSystemWindows(Rect). This means that the
         *  insets seen there will always represent the worst case that the application can
         *  expect as a continuous state. In the stock Android UI this is the space for the
         *  system bar, nav bar, and status bar, but not more transient elements such as an
         *  input method.
         *
         * Then if our field [mPaused] is false (we are playing) we add the following bit flags:
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_LOW_PROFILE -  View requests the system UI to enter an unobtrusive
         *  "low profile" mode. In low profile mode, the status bar and/or navigation icons may dim.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN - View requests that we go into the normal fullscreen
         *  mode so that our content can take over the screen while still allowing the user
         *  to interact with the application. Non-critical screen decorations (such as the
         *  status bar) will be hidden while the user is in the View's window.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION -  View requests that the system navigation be
         *  temporarily hidden. On devices that draw essential navigation controls (Home, Back,
         *  and the like) on screen, SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION will cause those to disappear.
         *
         *  * SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY - View would like to remain interactive when hiding
         *  the status bar with SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN and/or hiding the navigation bar with
         *  SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION. If this flag is not set, SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION
         *  will be force cleared by the system on any user interaction, and SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN
         *  will be force-cleared by the system if the user swipes from the top of the screen.
         *  When system bars are hidden in immersive mode, they can be revealed temporarily with
         *  system gestures, such as swiping from the top of the screen. These transient system
         *  bars will overlay app’s content, may have some degree of transparency, and will
         *  automatically hide after a short timeout. Since this flag is a modifier for
         *  SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_FULLSCREEN and SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_HIDE_NAVIGATION, it only has an effect
         *  when used in combination with one or both of those flags.
         *
         * We then call the method [setSystemUiVisibility] with the argument `newVis` to request
         * that the visibility of the status bar or other screen/window decorations be changed.
         * Finally we set our field [mUpdateSystemUi] to false.
