/**
 * An animation that rotates the view on the Y axis between two specified angles.
 * This animation also adds a translation on the Z axis (depth) to improve the effect.
 * Creates a new 3D rotation on the Y axis. The rotation is defined by its
 * start angle and its end angle. Both angles are in degrees. The rotation
 * is performed around a center point on the 2D space, definied by a pair
 * of X and Y coordinates, called [mCenterX] and [mCenterY]. When the animation
 * starts, a translation on the Z axis (depth) is performed. The length
 * of the translation can be specified, as well as whether the translation
 * should be reversed in time.
 *
 * @param mFromDegrees the start angle of the 3D rotation
 * @param mToDegrees the end angle of the 3D rotation
 * @param mCenterX the X center of the 3D rotation
 * @param mCenterY the Y center of the 3D rotation
 * @param mReverse true if the translation should be reversed, false otherwise

     * `camera` into `matrix` (which is the `Matrix` of our [Transformation] parameter [t]
     * recall), and restore the state of `camera` to that is held before we used it for our
