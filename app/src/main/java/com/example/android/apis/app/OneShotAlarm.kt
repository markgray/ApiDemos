    /**
     * This method is called when the BroadcastReceiver is receiving an Intent
     * broadcast.  During this time you can use the other methods on
     * BroadcastReceiver to view/modify the current result values.  This method
     * is always called within the main thread of its process, unless you
     * explicitly asked for it to be scheduled on a different thread using
     * [android.content.Context.registerReceiver]. When it runs on the main
     * thread you should never perform long-running operations in it (there
     * is a timeout of 10 seconds that the system allows before considering
     * the receiver to be blocked and a candidate to be killed). You cannot
     * launch a popup dialog in your implementation of onReceive().
     *
     * **If this BroadcastReceiver was launched through a `<receiver>` tag,
     * then the object is no longer alive after returning from this
     * function.**  This means you should not perform any operations that
     * return a result to you asynchronously -- in particular, for interacting
     * with services, you should use [Context.startService] instead of
     * [Context.bindService]. If you wish to interact with a service that is
     * already running, you can use [peekService].
     *
     * The Intent filters used in [android.content.Context.registerReceiver]
     * and in application manifests are *not* guaranteed to be exclusive. They
     * are hints to the operating system about how to find suitable recipients. It is
     * possible for senders to force delivery to specific recipients, bypassing filter
     * resolution.  For this reason, `onReceive(Context, Intent) onReceive()`
     * implementations should respond only to known actions, ignoring any unexpected
     * Intents that they may receive.
     *
     * We simply make a Toast stating that we have received a one shot alarm broadcast.
     *
     * @param context The Context in which the receiver is running.
     * @param intent The Intent being received.
