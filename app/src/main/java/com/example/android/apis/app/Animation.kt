     *  - R.anim.zoom_enter for the new Activity (uses a scale animation to scale from
     * 2.0 to 1.0 around a centered pivot point), and R.anim.zoom_exit for the old
     * Activity (uses a scale animation to scale from 1.0 to 0.5 around a centered

     *  - R.id.zoom_animation above.
     *  - R.id.scale_up_animation ("SCALE UP") is set to mScaleUpListener which uses an options
