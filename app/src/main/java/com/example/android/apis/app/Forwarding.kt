/**
 * Example of removing yourself from the history stack after forwarding to
 * another activity. This can be useful, for example, to implement
 * a confirmation dialog before the user goes on to another activity -- once the
 * user has confirmed this operation, they should not see the dialog again if they
 * go back from it.
 *
 * Note that another way to implement a confirmation dialog would be as
 * an activity that returns a result to its caller.  Either approach can be
 * useful depending on how it makes sense to structure the application.
