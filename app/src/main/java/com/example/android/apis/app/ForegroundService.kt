     *
     * If the action of our [Intent] parameter [intent] is either ACTION_FOREGROUND or
     * ACTION_FOREGROUND_WAKELOCK we initialize our [CharSequence] variable `val text` with the
     * string whose resource id is R.string.foreground_service_started ("Service is in the

     * that will start our activity [ForegroundServiceController] with a request code of 0 and 0
     * flags. We then build a [Notification] for `val notification` with a [Notification.Builder]
     * for notification channel PRIMARY_CHANNEL ("default"), setting its small icon to
     * R.drawable.stat_sample, its status text which is sent to accessibility services to `text`,

     * id R.string.alarm_service_label ("Sample Alarm Service"), its contents (second line of text)

     * supplying `notification` for the ongoing notification to be shown to the user while in this
     * state, and R.string.foreground_service_started as the identifier for this notification.
     *
     * If it is not one of the foreground actions but is either ACTION_BACKGROUND or
     * ACTION_BACKGROUND_WAKELOCK we call the [stopForeground] with the flag STOP_FOREGROUND_DETACH
     * (notification will remain shown, but be completely detached from the service and so no longer
     * changed except through direct calls to the notification manager) to remove this service from
     * foreground state, allowing it to be killed if more memory is needed.
     *
     * Now if the action of `intent` is either ACTION_FOREGROUND_WAKELOCK or ACTION_BACKGROUND_WAKELOCK
     * we branch on whether our field `WakeLock mWakeLock` is null:
     *
     *  * *null*: We initialize [mWakeLock] by using a handle to the system level service with
     *  class `PowerManager.class` to create a new wake lock with the level PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK
     *  (Ensures that the CPU is running; the screen and keyboard back-light will be allowed to go off)
     *  and the tag "myapp:wake-service" (for debugging purposes). We then call the `acquire` method
     *  of `mWakeLock` to acquire the wake lock with a timeout of 30 seconds.
     *  * not *null*: We call our [releaseWakeLock] method to release [mWakeLock] and
     *  set it to null.
     *
     * We then remove any pending posts of our [Runnable] field [mPulser] that are in the message
     * queue of our [Handler] field [mHandler] and then call the `run` method of [mPulser] to start
     * it running. Finally we return START_STICKY to the caller since we want this service to
     * continue running until it is explicitly stopped.
     *
     * @param intent  The [Intent] supplied to [android.content.Context.startService], as given.
     * This may be *null* if the service is being restarted after its process has gone
     * away, and it had previously returned anything except START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY.
     * @param flags   Additional data about this start request.
     * @param startId A unique integer representing this specific request to start. Use with
     * [stopSelfResult].
     * @return The return value indicates what semantics the system should use for the service's
     * current started state. It may be one of the constants associated with the
