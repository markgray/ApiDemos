     * variable `Button addButton` by finding the view with id R.id.addNewButton ("Add Button").
     * We set the `OnClickListener` of `addButton` to a lambda whose `onClick` override creates a
     * new button, sets its text to the string value of `numButtons` (post incrementing `numButtons`),
     * sets its `OnClickListener` to a lambda which will remove the button from `gridContainer` when
     * the button is clicked. The `onClick` override of `addButton` then adds the new button to
     * `gridContainer` at the location 0 for the first button then at position 1 for all the following
     * buttons. The GridView attribute android:animateLayoutChanges="true" causes a default
     * LayoutTransition object to be set on the ViewGroup container and default animations will run
     * when layout changes occur (both when adding and removing a button).
