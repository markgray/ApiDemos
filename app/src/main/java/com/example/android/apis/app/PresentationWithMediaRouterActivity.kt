/**
 * Presentation Activity
 *
 * This demonstrates how to create an activity that shows some content
 * on a secondary display using a [Presentation].
 *
 * The activity uses the [MediaRouter] API to automatically detect when
 * a presentation display is available and to allow the user to control the
 * media routes using a menu item. When a presentation display is available,
 * we stop showing content in the main activity and instead open up a
 * [Presentation] on the preferred presentation display. When a presentation
 * display is removed, we revert to showing content in the main activity.
 * We also write information about displays and display-related events to
 * the Android log which you can read using **adb logcat**.
 *
 * You can try this out using an HDMI or Wifi display or by using the
 * "Simulate secondary displays" feature in Development Settings to create a few
 * simulated secondary displays.  Each display will appear in the list along with a
 * checkbox to show a presentation on that display.
 *
 * See also the [PresentationActivity] sample which uses the low-level display manager
 * to enumerate displays and to show multiple simultaneous presentations on different
 * displays.
 * RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1)
