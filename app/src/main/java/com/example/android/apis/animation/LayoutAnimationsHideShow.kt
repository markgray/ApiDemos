     * For the CHANGE_APPEARING (Changing while Adding) part of the animation it defines property
     * value holders to animate property "left" from 0 to 1, "top" from 0 to 1, "right" from 0 to 1,
     * "bottom" from 0 to 1, "scaleX" from 1f to 0f to 1f, "scaleY" from 1f to 0f to 1f. It then
     * creates an ObjectAnimator changeIn for these properties, sets its duration to use the
     * same duration of the current LayoutTransition mTransitioner and sets changeIn to be the
     * CHANGE_APPEARING animation of mTransitioner. It adds an AnimatorListenerAdapter to changeIn
     * which overrides onAnimationEnd and scales the Button added to full size. This animation has
     * has the appearance of a card flipping right to left from the back side to the front side.
     * You can see this animation in action by clicking the SHOW BUTTONS Button after deleting
     * Button's with the "Hide (GONE)" CheckBox checked.
     *
     * For the CHANGE_DISAPPEARING (Changing while Removing) part of the animation it defines an
     * additional PropertyValueHolder for "rotation" constructed of three KeyFrame's (kf0 - a
     * starting value of the rotation of 0f lasting 0f, kf1 - a rotation of 360f degrees lasting
     * .9999f of the frame, and kf2 - an ending rotation of 0f degrees. It combines these in the
     * "rotation" property value holder pvhRotation, then combines the "left", "top", "right", and
     * "bottom" PropertyValuesHolder's used for the CHANGE_APPEARING animation to create the
     * ObjectAnimator changeOut, sets the duration of changeOut to be the same as the current
     * LayoutTransition mTransitioner, and sets changeOut to be the CHANGE_DISAPPEARING animation
     * of mTransitioner. It adds an AnimatorListenerAdapter to changeOut which overrides
     * onAnimationEnd to set the rotation of the Button to 0f degrees. It has the effect of rotating
     * the Button's to the right of the Button removed clockwise when the "Hide (GONE)" CheckBox
     * is checked while moving them into their new positions.
     *
     * For the APPEARING (Adding) part of the animation it creates a simple "rotationY"
     * ObjectAnimator animIn which rotates the Button from 90f degrees to 0f degrees, sets
     * the duration of animIn to be the same as the current LayoutTransition mTransitioner, and
     * sets animIn to be the APPEARING animation of mTransitioner. It add an AnimatorListenerAdapter
     * to animIn which overrides onAnimationEnd to set the rotation of the Button to 0f degrees.
     * It has the effect of rotating the appearing Button's about the y axis when the SHOW BUTTONS
     * button is pressed (after removing a Button or two), starting from sticking directly out of
     * the plane of the View, to flat.
     *
     * For the DISAPPEARING (Removing) part of the animation it creates a simple "rotationX"
     * ObjectAnimator animOut which rotates the Button from 0f degrees (flat) to 90f degrees
     * (sticking out of the plane), sets the duration of animOut to be the same as the current
     * LayoutTransition mTransitioner, and sets animOut to be the DISAPPEARING animation of
     * mTransitioner. It add an AnimatorListenerAdapter to animOut which overrides onAnimationEnd
     * to set the rotation of the Button to 0f degrees. It has the effect of rotating the
     * disappearing Button about the x axis when the Button is clicked starting from flat to
     * sticking vertically out of the plane.
