/**
 * This activity demonstrates two different ways in which views can be made more secure to
 * touch spoofing attacks by leveraging framework features.
 *
 * The activity presents 3 buttons that ostensibly perform a risky security critical
 * function. Under ordinary circumstances, the user would never click on these buttons
 * or would at least think long and hard about it. However, a carefully crafted toast can
 * overlay the contents of the activity in such a way as to make the user believe the buttons
 * are innocuous.  Since the toast cannot receive input, the touches are passed down to the
 * activity potentially yielding an effect other than what the user intended.
 *
 * To simulate the spoofing risk, this activity pops up a specially crafted overlay as
 * a toast laid out so as to cover the buttons and part of the descriptive text.
 * For the purposes of this demonstration, pretend that the overlay was actually popped
 * up by a malicious application published by the International Cabal of Evil Penguins.
 *
 * The 3 buttons are set up as follows:
 *
 *  1. The "unsecured button" does not apply any touch filtering of any kind.
 *  When the toast appears, this button remains clickable as usual which creates an
 *  opportunity for spoofing to occur.
 *
 *  2. The "built-in secured button" leverages the android:filterTouchesWhenObscured view
 *  attribute to ask the framework to filter out touches when the window is obscured.
 *  When the toast appears, the button does not receive the touch and appears to be inoperable.
 *
 *  3. The "custom secured button" adds a touch listener to the button which intercepts the
 *  touch event and checks whether the window is obscured.  If so, it warns the user and
 *  drops the touch event.  This example is intended to demonstrate how a view can
 *  perform its own filtering and provide additional feedback by examining the `MotionEvent`
 *  flags to determine whether the window is obscured. Here we use a touch listener but
 *  a custom view subclass could perform the filtering by overriding
 *  `View.onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent)`.
 *
 * Refer to the comments on [View] for more information about view security.
