     *  we set it to *false*, if it is *false* we append ", " to `sb` then append `auth` to `sb`.
     *  When done with the list of content authorities that triggered us, we check whether the
     *  `getTriggeredContentUris` method of [params] is not *null* (returns which URIs have
     *  triggered  this job), and if it is not we loop through the [Uri] `uri` in the list of [Uri]

     *
     * We now toast a message containing `sb` converted to a [String], and log it as well, then
     * add [Runnable] field [mWorker] to the queue of [Handler] field [mHandler] to be run after a
