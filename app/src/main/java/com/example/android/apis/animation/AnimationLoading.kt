         *  of 1 and a repeatMode of "reverse", and sets the UpdateListener to an

         *  balls[1] to the current value of the animation (relying on the call to
         *  invalidate() for balls[0] to trigger a re-draw of the View.)
         *  - balls[2] (350,50) Uses an AnimatorSet seq which it creates by loading the file
         *  R.animator.animator_set which creates two objectAnimator's to animate the "x"
         *  value from the current value to 200, and the "y" value from the current value
         *  to 400 with a repeat count of 1 and a repeatMode of "reverse"
         *  - balls[3] (500,50) Color.GREEN Uses an ObjectAnimator colorizer which it creates by

         *  of the ShapeHolder holding balls[3] from "#0f0" to "#00ffff" with a repeat
         *  count of 1 and a repeatMode of "reverse"

         *  from 0 to 200 using propertyValuesHolder's

         *  keyframe specs for x and y and uses the default linear interpolator

         *  keyframe specs for a value, it then sets the UpdateListener to an

         *  to the current animated value.
