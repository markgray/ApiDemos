     * First we disable dithering, then we use the method `glHint` to set the implementation

     * texture to the texturing target GL_TEXTURE_2D (While a texture is bound, GL operations on the

     * is bound return state from the bound texture. In effect, the texture targets become aliases
     * for the textures currently bound to them, and the texture name zero refers to the default
     * textures that were bound to them at initialization.)
     *
     * Now we set the texture parameters for GL_TEXTURE_2D:
     *
     *  * GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER set to GL_NEAREST (The texture minifying function used whenever
     *  the level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture determines that the
     *  texture should be minified: GL_NEAREST Returns the value of the texture element that
     *  is nearest (in Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.)

     *  * GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER set to GL_LINEAR (The texture magnification function is used
     *  whenever the level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture determines
     *  that the texture should be magnified: GL_LINEAR Returns the weighted average of the
     *  texture elements that are closest to the specified texture coordinates.)
     *
     *  * GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE (Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate s to
     *  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: causes s coordinates to be clamped to the range [1/2N,1âˆ’1/2N], where N is
     *  the size of the texture in the direction of clamping)
     *
     *  * GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE (Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate t to
     *  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: see the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S)
     *
     * Then we set the target texture environment GL_TEXTURE_ENV texture environment parameter
     * GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE to the texture function GL_REPLACE. Finally we call the `load`
     * method of our [TextureLoader] field [mTextureLoader] to load the texture image.

         * Init block for our Constructor it allocates and initializes the content of the three
         * fields we use to draw a triangle: `FloatBuffer` field ` mFVertexBuffer`, `FloatBuffer`
         * field `mTexBuffer`, and `ShortBuffer` field `mIndexBuffer`.
         *
         * First: we allocate a direct byte buffer on the native heap for `ByteBuffer` `val vbb`,
         * and set its byte order to native order. We use `vbb` to create a view of this byte
         * buffer as a float buffer which we store in the `FloatBuffer` field `mFVertexBuffer`.
         *
         * Second: we allocate a direct byte buffer on the native heap for `ByteBuffer` `val tbb`,
         * and set its byte order to native order. We use `tbb` to create a view of this byte
         * buffer as a float buffer which we store in the `FloatBuffer` field `mTexBuffer`.
         *
         * Third: we allocate a direct byte buffer on the native heap for `ByteBuffer` `val ibb`,
         * and set its byte order to native order. We use `ibb` to create a view of this byte
         * buffer as a short buffer which we store in the `ShortBuffer` field `mIndexBuffer`.
         *
         * In `FloatArray` `val coords` we declare the coordinates of a unit-sided equilateral
         * triangle centered on the origin.
         *
         * We load each of the three, three dimensional points in `coords` into `FloatBuffer` field
         * `mFVertexBuffer` (each coordinate scaled by 2.0 for some reason). We load the x and y
         * coordinates of each of the three points in `coords` into `FloatBuffer` field `mTexBuffer`
         * (each coordinate scaled by 2.0 and offset by 0.5 for some reason). And we load the three
         * indices 0, 1, and 2 into `ShortBuffer` fuked `mIndexBuffer`.
         *
         * Finally we set the position of each of the buffers `mFVertexBuffer`, `mTexBuffer` and
         * `mIndexBuffer` to 0, so that the `gl*Pointer()` functions can read them from the
         * beginning.
