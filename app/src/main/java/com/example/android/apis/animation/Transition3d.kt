 * show the picture. When the user clicks the picture, it flips to show the
 * list. The animation is made of two smaller animations: the first half
 * rotates the list by 90 degrees on the Y axis and the second half rotates
 * the picture by 90 degrees on the Y axis. When the first half finishes, the
 * list is made invisible and the picture is set visible.
