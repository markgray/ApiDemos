             * hangs before the view can be displayed). Next we create [ClipData] `val data` to be

             * "dot" as the user-visible label for the clip data, and a formatted string which
             * contains the text "Dot : " concatenated to the string value of [View] parameter [v]
             * as the actual text in the clip. Next we call the [startDrag] method of [View]
             * parameter [v] to start a drag and drop operation using `data` as the [ClipData]
             * object pointing to the data to be transferred by the drag and drop operation, an
             * [ANRShadowBuilder] object for building the drag shadow which is constructed using
             * [v] as the [View] (any [View] in scope can be used) and if [mAnrType] is equal to
             * ANR_SHADOW the [Boolean] flag value *true* so that an ANR will be generated when the
             * dot is long-clicked (this dot is nasty) otherwise false so the dot is a normal dot.
             * We also include [v] cast to [Any] in the arguments of [startDrag] to use as the local
             * state Object which contains local data about the drag and drop operation, and 0 for
             * the flags that control the drag and drop operation (no flags). Finally we return true
