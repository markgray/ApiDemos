/**

 * is a tailored widget developed by extending the base classes in the android.view
 * package. This sample shows how to implement the accessibility behavior via both
 * inheritance (non backwards compatible) and composition (backwards compatible).
 *
 * While the Android framework has a diverse portfolio of views tailored for various
 * use cases, sometimes a developer needs a specific functionality not implemented
 * by the standard views. A solution is to write a custom view that extends one of the
 * base view classes. While implementing the desired functionality a developer should
 * also implement accessibility support for that new functionality such that
