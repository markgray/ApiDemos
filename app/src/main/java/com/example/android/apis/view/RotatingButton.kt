     * Called when the activity is starting. First we call through to our super's implementation of
     * `onCreate`, then we set our content view to our layout file R.layout.rotating_view.
     * We initialize our [Button] variable `val rotatingButton` by finding the view with the ID
     * R.id.rotatingButton. We initialize our [SeekBar] variable `val seekBar` by finding
     * the view with the ID R.id.translationX, set its upper range to 400, then set its
     * `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which sets the horizontal location of
     * `rotatingButton` relative to its left position based on the value set in the [SeekBar]
     * by the user. We again set `seekBar` by finding the view with the ID R.id.translationY,
     * set its upper range to 800, then set its `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class
     * which sets the vertical location of `rotatingButton` relative to its top position based on
     * the value set in the [SeekBar] by the user. We again set `seekBar` by finding the
     * view with the ID R.id.scaleX, set its upper range to 50, set its current progress to 10 then
     * set its `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which scales the X size of
     * `rotatingButton` as a proportion of the view's unscaled width based on the value set in
     * the [SeekBar] by the user divided by 10. We again set `seekBar` by finding the view with
     * the ID R.id.scaleY, set its upper range to 50, set its current progress to 10 then set its
     * `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which scales the Y size of `rotatingButton`
     * as a proportion of the view's unscaled height based on the value set in the [SeekBar] by the
     * user divided by 10.
     *
     * We again set `seekBar` by finding the view with the ID R.id.rotationX, set its upper
     * range to 360, then set its `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which sets
     * the degrees that `rotatingButton` is rotated around the horizontal axis through the
     * pivot point to the value set in the [SeekBar] by the user.
     *
     * We again set `seekBar` by finding the view with the ID R.id.rotationY, set its upper
     * range to 360, then set its `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which sets
     * the degrees that `rotatingButton` is rotated around the vertical axis through the
     * pivot point to the value set in the [SeekBar] by the user.
     *
     * We again set `seekBar` by finding the view with the ID R.id.rotationZ, set its upper
     * range to 360, then set its `OnSeekBarChangeListener` to an anonymous class which sets
     * the degrees that `rotatingButton` is rotated around the pivot point to the value set in
     * the [SeekBar] by the user.
