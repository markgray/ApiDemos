     * Called when the activity is starting. First we call through to our super's implementation of
     * `onCreate`. Then we initialize our `TabHost` variable `val tabHost` by retrieving the
     * `TabHost` our activity is using to host its tabs. We add three tabs to `tabHost` using its
     * `addTab` method to add tab specs created with the tags "tab1", "tab2", and "tab3", use the
     * strings "list", "photo list", and "destroy" to set the indicator labels, and set the content
     * to an [Intent] to launch the activities `List1`, `List8` and `Controls1` respectively. The
     * [Intent] for the third tab has the flag FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP set as well (If set, and the
     * activity being launched is already running in the current task, then instead of launching a
     * new instance of that activity, all of the other activities on top of it will be closed and
     * this Intent will be delivered to the (now on top) old activity as a new Intent). So while the
     * first two tabs recall their content, the third one starts from scratch every time it is selected.
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState we do not override [onSaveInstanceState] so do not use.
