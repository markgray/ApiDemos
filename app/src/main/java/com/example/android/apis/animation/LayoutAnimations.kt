     * value holders to animate property "left" from 0 to 1, "top" from 0 to 1, "right" from 0 to 1,
     * "bottom" from 0 to 1, "scaleX" from 1f to 0f to 1f, "scaleY" from 1f to 0f to 1f. It then
     * creates an ObjectAnimator customChangingAppearingAnim for these properties, sets its duration
     * to use the same duration of the current LayoutTransition transition and sets
     * customChangingAppearingAnim to be the CHANGE_APPEARING animation of transition. It adds an
     * AnimatorListenerAdapter to customChangingAppearingAnim which overrides onAnimationEnd and
     * scales the Button added to full size. This animation has has the appearance of a card
     * flipping right to left from the back side to the front side. You can see this animation in
     * action by clicking the ADD BUTTON Button when both the "Custom Animations" and "In"
     * CheckBox are checked.
     *
     * For the CHANGE_DISAPPEARING (Changing while Removing) part of the animation it defines an
     * additional PropertyValueHolder for "rotation" constructed of three KeyFrame's (kf0 - a
     * starting value of the rotation of 0f lasting 0f, kf1 - a rotation of 360f degrees lasting
     * .9999f of the frame, and kf2 - an ending rotation of 0f degrees. It combines these in the
     * "rotation" property value holder pvhRotation, then combines the "left", "top", "right", and
     * "bottom" PropertyValuesHolder's used for the CHANGE_APPEARING animation to create the
     * ObjectAnimator customChangingDisappearingAnim, sets the duration of
     * customChangingDisappearingAnim to be the same as the current LayoutTransition transition,
     * and sets customChangingDisappearingAnim to be the CHANGE_DISAPPEARING animation of
     * transition. It adds an AnimatorListenerAdapter to customChangingDisappearingAnim which
     * overrides onAnimationEnd to set the rotation of the Button to 0f degrees. It has the
     * effect of rotating the Button's to the right of the Button removed clockwise while moving
     * them into their new positions when both the "Custom Animations" and "Out" CheckBox are checked.
     *
     * For the APPEARING (Adding) part of the animation it creates a simple "rotationY"
     * ObjectAnimator customAppearingAnim which rotates the Button from 90f degrees to 0f degrees,
     * sets the duration of customAppearingAnim to be the same as the current LayoutTransition
     * transition, and sets customAppearingAnim to be the APPEARING animation of transition. It
     * adds an AnimatorListenerAdapter to customAppearingAnim which overrides onAnimationEnd to
     * set the rotation of the Button to 0f degrees. It has the effect of rotating the appearing
     * Button's about the y axis when the ADD BUTTON button is pressed, starting from sticking
     * directly out of the plane of the View, to flat when both the "Custom Animations" and
     * "Changing In" CheckBox are checked.
     *
     * For the DISAPPEARING (Removing) part of the animation it creates a simple "rotationX"
     * ObjectAnimator customDisappearingAnim which rotates the Button from 0f degrees (flat) to
     * 90f degrees (sticking out of the plane), sets the duration of customDisappearingAnim to
     * be the same as the current LayoutTransition transition, and sets customDisappearingAnim
     * to be the DISAPPEARING animation of transition. It add an AnimatorListenerAdapter to
     * customDisappearingAnim which overrides onAnimationEnd to set the rotation of the Button
     * to 0f degrees. It has the effect of rotating the disappearing Button about the x axis
