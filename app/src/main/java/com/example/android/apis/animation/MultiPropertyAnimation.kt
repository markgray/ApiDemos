         * of "DURATION" (1500 milliseconds). It results in a ball which falls from
         * the top of the screen and bounces several times at the bottom of the screen.
         * The AnimatorUpdateListener is set to "this" and the overridden callback
         * this.onAnimationUpdate merely invalidates the View causing our onDraw callback
         * to be called for every frame of this animation in order to draw all four balls.
         *  - `balls[1]` ObjectAnimator yAlphaBouncer is an ObjectAnimator constructed from two
         * PropertyValuesHolder's pvhY (animates "y" from the top to bottom of the View)
         * and pvhAlpha (animates "alpha" from 1.0f to 0.0f). Its duration is set to
         * "DURATION/2" (750 milliseconds), its TimeInterpolator is set to an instance
         * of AccelerateInterpolator, its repeat count is 1, and the repeat mode is REVERSE.
         * This results in a ball which drops from the top to the bottom while fading out
         * at the same time, then returning to the top while fading in.
         *  - `balls[2]` ObjectAnimator whxyBouncer is an ObjectAnimator created from 4 PropertyValuesHolder's
         * pvhW ("width"), pvhH ("height"), pvTX ("x"), and pvTY ("y") using the method
         * ObjectAnimator.ofPropertyValuesHolder with a duration of DURATION/2 (750
         * milliseconds), a repeat count of 1 and a repeat mode of REVERSE. It has the
         * effect of expanding the size of the ball then shrinking it back to the
         * original size without moving.
         *  - `balls[3]` ObjectAnimator yxBouncer is an ObjectAnimator created from PropertyValuesHolder's
         * for "x" and "y" (pvhX and pvhY). pvhY animates "y" from the top to the bottom
         * of the View using the default linear animation, pvhX is a PropertyValuesHolder
         * created from three Keyframe's (kf0, kf1, and kf2) which divides the animation of
         * "x" into three segments moving the "x" coordinate of the ball's ShapeHolder from
         * the current position to 100f pixels to right, to 50f pixels to the right. The
         * duration of yxBouncer is set to DURATION/2 (750 milliseconds), the repeat count
         * is 1, and the repeat mode is REVERSE. The result is a ball which falls from the
         * top of the View to the bottom with a slight jog to the right, and then rises
         * back to the top using the same track.
         *
         * Then the field bounceAnim is set to an instance of AnimatorSet with all four ball
         * animations set up to play at the same time.
