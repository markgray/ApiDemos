     *  of 300 milliseconds, and an `<alpha>` from 1.0 to 0.0 also with a duration of 300
     *  milliseconds.
     *
     *  * R.anim.push_left_in - contains a `<translate>` for x from 100p to 0p with a duration

     *  milliseconds.

     *  of 300 milliseconds, and an `<alpha>` from 1.0 to 0.0 also with a duration of 300
     *  milliseconds.

     *  * android.R.anim.fade_in - contains an `<alpha>` from 0.0 to 1.0 using an interpolator
     *  of android:interpolator="@interpolator/decelerate_quad", and a duration of config_longAnimTime
     *  (500 milliseconds).

     *  of android:interpolator="@interpolator/accelerate_quad", and a duration of config_mediumAnimTime
     *  (400 milliseconds).

     *  * R.anim.hyperspace_in - contains an `<alpha>` from 0.0 to 1.0, with a duration of 300

     *
     *  * R.anim.hyperspace_out - contains a `<scale>` that scales x from 1.0 to 1.4, y from
     *  1.0 to 0.6, android:pivotX="50%", android:pivotY="50%", android:fillEnabled="true",
     *  android:fillAfter="false" and a duration of 700 milliseconds. This is followed by a
     *  `<set>` which contains a `<scale>` and a `<rotate>`, both with a start
     *  offset of 700 milliseconds. The `<set>` uses accelerate_interpolator as its interpolator,
