/**
 * [android.view.View.requestFocus] and [android.view.View.onFocusChanged] work together to give a
 * newly focused item a hint about the most interesting rectangle of the previously focused view.
 * The view taking focus can use this to set an internal selection more appropriate using this rect.
 *
 * This Activity exercises that behavior using three adjacent [InternalSelectionView]
 * that report interesting rects when giving up focus, and use interesting rects
 * when taking focus to best select the internal row to show as selected.
 *
 * Were [InternalSelectionView] not to override [android.view.View.getFocusedRect], or
 * [android.view.View.onFocusChanged], the focus would jump to some default internal selection
 * (the top) and not allow for the smooth hand-off.
 *
 * Need keys to move focus, so I do not know what this does.

     * its layout parameters for width and height both to MATCH_PARENT. We create an new instance
     * for [LinearLayout.LayoutParams] `val params` with a width of 0, height of MATCH_PARENT, and a
     * weight of 1.
     *
     * We create [InternalSelectionView] `val leftColumn` with 5 rows and the label "left column",
     * set its layout parameters to `param`, its padding to 10 on all 4 sides and add it to
     * `layout`.
     *
     * We create [InternalSelectionView] `val middleColumn` with 5 rows and the label "middle column",
     * set its layout parameters to `param`, its padding to 10 on all 4 sides and add it to
     * `layout`.
     *
     * We create [InternalSelectionView] `val rightColumn` with 5 rows and the label "right column",
     * set its layout parameters to `param`, its padding to 10 on all 4 sides and add it to
     * `layout`.
     *
     * Finally we set our content view to `layout`.
     *
     * @param savedInstanceState we do not override [onSaveInstanceState] so do not use.
