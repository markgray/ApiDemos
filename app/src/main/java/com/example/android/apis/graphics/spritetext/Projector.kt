     * Given the relative location of a label, we calculate the absolute location it must have when
     * the moving model view, projection, and view port are taken into consideration. In our case
     * this keeps the labels for the three vertices of the rotating triangle in sync with the
     * triangle.
     *
     * First we check if our flag [mMVPComputed] is *false*, and if so we multiply the current
     * projection matrix that our [MatrixGrabber] field [mGrabber] has retrieved to its `mProjection`
     * field by the model view matrix held in its `mModelView` field and save the results in our
     * [FloatArray] field [mMVP]. We then set [mMVPComputed] to *true*.
     *
     * Now that we have an up to date model view projection matrix in [mMVP] we multiply the
     * input vector [obj] by it and save the result in [FloatArray] field [mV]. We calculate the
     * value needed to normalize the vector `val rw` by calculating the inverse of the "w" coordinate
     * contained in `mV[3]` which has been de-normalized by the projection matrix (W is the fourth
     * coordinate of a three dimensional vertex; This vertex is called the homogeneous vertex coordinate.
     * In few words, the W component is a factor which divides the other vector components. When W is
     * 1.0, the homogeneous vertex coordinates are "normalized". To compare two vertices, you should
     * normalize the W value to 1.0).
     *
     * Finally we calculate the output vertex locations by normalizing each coordinate in turn, adding
     * 1.0 to the 0.0 to 1.0 result, and multiplying by 0.5 to move (0,0) to the center of the 0.0 to
     * 1.0 space. We multiply this by the view width [mViewWidth] and add the x coordinate of the
     * lower left corner to get the output x coordinate for `win[winOffset]`, and multiply this
     * by the view height [mViewHeight] and add the y coordinate of the lower left corner to get
     * the output y coordinate `win[winOffset+1]`. We also calculate the z coordinate but it not
     * used by our caller so I won't comment on the calculation
     *
     * @param obj       Relative (x,y.0,1) coordinates of label location.
     * @param objOffset Offset into `obj` for first element of the vector
     * @param win       Output vector for the absolute (x,y.z) coordinates of label location
     *                  in moving model view
     * @param winOffset Offset into `win` for first element of the vector
