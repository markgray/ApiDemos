/**
 * This class demonstrates how to implement custom printing support.
 *
 * This activity shows the list of the MotoGp champions by year and
 * brand. The print option in the overflow menu allows the user to
 * print the content. The list of items is laid out so that it fits
 * the options selected by the user from the UI such as page size.
 * Hence, for different page sizes the printed content will have
 * different page count.
 *
 * This sample demonstrates how to completely implement a [PrintDocumentAdapter]
 * in which:
 *
 *  * Layout based on the selected print options is performed.
 *  * Layout work is performed only if print options change would change the content.
 *  * Layout result is properly reported.
 *  * Only requested pages are written.
 *  * Write result is properly reported.
 *  * Both Layout and write respond to cancellation.
 *  * Layout and render of views is demonstrated.

         *
         * After you are done laying out, you **must** invoke: `LayoutResultCallback.onLayoutFinished`
         * with the last argument *true* or *false* depending on whether the layout changed the
         * content or not, respectively; or
         * `LayoutResultCallback.onLayoutFailed`, if an error occurred;

         * which is you will not receive any calls to this adapter until the current
         * layout operation is complete by invoking a method on the callback instance.
         * The callback methods can be invoked from an arbitrary thread.
         *
         * One of the arguments passed to this method is a [CancellationSignal]
         * which is used to propagate requests from the system to your application for
         * canceling the current layout operation. For example, a cancellation may be
         * requested if the user changes a print option that may affect layout while
         * you are performing a layout operation. In such a case the system will make
         * an attempt to cancel the current layout as another one will have to be performed.
         * Typically, you should register a cancellation callback in the cancellation
         * signal. The cancellation callback **will not** be made on the
         * main thread and can be registered as follows:
         *
         *     cancellationSignal.setOnCancelListener(new OnCancelListener() {
         *         @Override
         *         public void onCancel() {
         *            // Cancel layout
         *         }
         *     });
         *
         * **Note:** If the content is large and a layout will be performed, it is a good practice
         * to schedule the work on a dedicated thread and register an observer in the provided
         * [CancellationSignal] upon invocation of which you should stop the layout.
         *
         * First we check whether we have already been canceled by calling the `isCanceled()`
         * method of our [CancellationSignal] parameter [cancellationSignal], and if so we just
         * call the `onLayoutCancelled` callback of our `LayoutResultCallback` parameter [callback]
         * and return having done nothing.
         *
         * Next we set a [Boolean] flag `var layoutNeeded` to *false*, assuming that we will not
         * need to do a layout after all. Next we compute the [Int] value `val density` to be
         * the max of the Horizontal DPI and Vertical DPI of our parameter [PrintAttributes]
         * parameter [newAttributes]. We use this to calculate the `marginLeft`, `marginRight` and
         * `contentWidth` we are to use based on the Media size specified in our [PrintAttributes]
         * parameter [newAttributes]. If the value stashed in our [Int] field [mRenderPageWidth]
         * is not equal to `contextWidth`, we set it to `contextWidth` and set our `layoutNeeded`
         * flag to *true*. In a similar way we calculate the Content height given [newAttributes]
         * for our [Int] `val contentHeight`, and if the value stashed in our [Int] field
         * [mRenderPageHeight] is not the same we set [mRenderPageHeight] to `contentHeight` and
         * set our `layoutNeeded` flag to *true*.
         *
         * Next if we have yet to set our [Context] field [mPrintContext], or the DPI it uses is
         * different from the `density` we calculated above we create a [Configuration] for
         * `val configuration`, set its field `densityDpi` to `density`, set [mPrintContext] to a
         * [Context] created from `configuration` and set its theme to the system theme
         * android.R.style.Theme_Holo_Light.
         *
         * Now if our flag `layoutNeeded` is still *false*, we call the callback
         * `callback.onLayoutFinished(mDocumentInfo, false)` and return.
         *
         * Otherwise we have work to do. We clone the contents of our `ListAdapter` into
         * `List<MotoGpStatItem>` variable `val items` so that a background thread can access it,
         * then launch an anonymous [MotoGpOnLayoutAsyncTask] constructed using our parameters
         * [cancellationSignal], and [newAttributes], our `List` of [MotoGpStatItem]'s in `items`
         * and our parameter [callback] to do all the work for us.

         * After you are done writing, you should close the file descriptor and invoke

         * if writing completed successfully; or the `onWriteFailed` method if an error occurred;
         * or the `onWriteCancelled` method if writing was cancelled in a response to a cancellation
         * request via the passed in [CancellationSignal] parameter [cancellationSignal].

         * to be considered complete which is you will not receive any calls to this adapter until
         * the current write operation is complete by invoking a method on the callback instance.
         * The callback methods can be invoked from an arbitrary thread.
         *
         * One of the arguments passed to this method is a [CancellationSignal]
         * which is used to propagate requests from the system to your application for
         * canceling the current write operation. For example, a cancellation may be
         * requested if the user changes a print option that may affect layout while
         * you are performing a write operation. In such a case the system will make
         * an attempt to cancel the current write as a layout will have to be performed
         * which then may be followed by a write. Typically, you should register a
         * cancellation callback in the cancellation signal. The cancellation callback
         * **will not** be made on the main thread and can be registered
         * as follows:
         *
         *      cancellationSignal.setOnCancelListener(new OnCancelListener() {
         *          @Override
         *          public void onCancel() {
         *              // Cancel write
         *          }
         *      });
         *
         * **Note:** If the printed content is large, it is a good practice to schedule writing it
         * on a dedicated thread and register an observer in the provided [CancellationSignal] upon
         * invocation of which you should stop writing.
         *
         * First we check whether we have already been canceled by calling the `isCanceled` method
         * of our [CancellationSignal] parameter [cancellationSignal], and if so we just call the
         * `onWriteCancelled` callback of our `LayoutResultCallback` parameter [callback] and
         * return having done nothing.
         *
         * Otherwise we have work to do. We clone the contents of our `ListAdapter` into a
         * `List<MotoGpStatItem>` variable `val items` so that a background thread can access it,
         * then launch an anonymous [MotoGpOnWriteAsyncTask] constructed using our parameter
         * [cancellationSignal], our `List` of [MotoGpStatItem]'s in `items`, our parameter [pages],
         * and our parameter [callback] to do all the work for us.

             * item view type `var viewType` to -1 to indicate that we do not currently have a
             * `View view` of the correct type for our `adapter` to reuse and need to request one
             * by passing *null* for the `convertView` when calling `getView`. We initialize the

             * to null, and the [PdfDocument.Page] `var page` whose canvas we are currently
             * drawing to for the current page to *null*. We construct a [LinearLayout] for our
             * `val dummyParent` in order to use it for `LayoutParams` when calling `adapter.getView`,
             * and set its orientation to VERTICAL. We compute a [Float] scaling factor `val scale`
             * in order to convert our layout and rendering which is done in pixels to points (1/72")
             * which is used by the PDF canvas. We set [Int] `val itemCount` to the total number of
             * data items contained in our [MotoGpStatAdapter] `adapter` and then loop for each of
             * these using `i` as the index.

             * After making sure we have not been canceled first, for each item `i` contained in
             * `adapter` we fetch the type of the view to `val nextViewType`, and if it is the same
             * as `viewType` (the type of the current [View] in `view`) we pass `view` to
             * `adapter.getView` to be recycled when requesting it to render the item `i` into a
             * [View] we can set `view` to, otherwise we pass *null* so that it will allocate and
             * layout a new [View] before rendering item `i`. We set `viewType` to `newViewType` to
             * cause the [View] to be recycled on the next pass. We then call our method `measureView`
             * to instruct `view` to measure itself based on the printer page dimensions, and add the
             * measured height of the [View] in `view` to `pageContentHeight`.
             *
             * Then if this is the first time through the loop (`currentPage` < 0) or the size of
             * the current page is greater than the size of the printer page ( that is:
             * `pageContentHeight > mRenderPageHeight`) we set `pageContentHeight` to the height
             * of the [View] `view`, increment `currentPage`, and if we have a page ready to print
             * (not the first time through the loop, and the last page was among those requested to
             * be printed) we finish the [PdfDocument.Page] `page` we have been working on in our
             * [PrintedPdfDocument] field [mPdfDocument].
             *
             * We look through the `PageRanges[]` parmater [pages] for the `currentPage` using our
             * method [containsPage], and if it is a wanted page number we start a new
             * [PdfDocument.Page] for `page`, fetch its `Canvas` in order to scale it using our
             * pixels to points scaling factor `scale` and append `currentPage` to our list of
             * written pages in the [SparseIntArray] field [mWrittenPages]. If it is not a wanted
             * page we set `page` to *null*.
             *
             * Then if `page` is not *null*, we layout [View] `view` and instruct it to draw
