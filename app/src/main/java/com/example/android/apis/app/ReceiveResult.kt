/**
 * Shows how an activity can send data to its launching activity when done.
 *
 * This can be used, for example, to implement a dialog allowing the user to
 * pick an e-mail address or image -- the picking activity sends the selected
 * data back to the originating activity when done.
 *
 * The example here is composed of two activities: [ReceiveResult] launches
 * the picking activity and receives its results; [SendResult] allows the user
 * to pick something and sends the selection back to its caller.  Implementing
 * this functionality involves the
 * [setResult()][android.app.Activity.setResult] method for sending a result and
 * [ActivityResultLauncher] to receive it.
 *
 * Demo App/Activity/Receive Result
 *
 * Source files
 *  - src/com.example.android.apis/app/ReceiveResult.java Launches pick activity and receives
 *  its result</td>
 *  - src/com.example.android.apis/app/SendResult.java Allows user to pick an option and sends it
