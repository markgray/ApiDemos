     * `Cube` objects setting the color of the [GLFace] facing out as follows:

     *  [Cube] objects in [mCubes] (18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26)
     *
     *  * left of Rubic cube - yellow. This includes all the `Cube.kLeft` faces of the 9
     *  [Cube] objects in [mCubes] (0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24)
     *
     *  * right of Rubic cube - white. This includes all the `Cube.kRight` faces of the 9
     *  [Cube] objects in [mCubes] (2,5,8,11,15,17,20,23,26)
     *
     *  * back of Rubic cube - blue. This includes all the `Cube.kBack` faces of the 9
     *  [Cube] objects in [mCubes] (0,1,2,9,10,11,18,19,20)
     *
     *  * front of Rubic cube - green. This includes all the `Cube.kFront` faces of the 9
     *  [Cube] objects in [mCubes] (6,7,8,15,16,17,24,25,26)
     *
     * Then for each of the 27 [Cube] objects in [mCubes] we call the method
     * `world.addShape` to add the [GLShape] to its list of [Cube] objects in
     * its `ArrayList<GLShape>` field `mShapeList`.
     *
     * Next we initialize our [Int] array field [mPermutation] with the numbers (0,1,...,26)
     * representing an initial "solved" ordering of [Cube] objects. We call our method
     * [createLayers] to allocate and construct the 9 layers initializing the axis they can
     * rotate about, and call our method [updateLayers] to assign each of the [Cube] objects
     * to the [Layer] that it belongs to in the solved initial position that [mPermutation]
     * currently represents.
     *
     * Then we call the method `world.generate` which allocates and fills the direct allocated
     * buffers required by the method `glDrawElements` when it draws our Rubic cube. Finally we
     * return `world` to the caller (in our case the call to the constructor of the
     * [KubeRenderer] that is used to initialize our [KubeRenderer] field [mRenderer] in
     * this activities override of `onCreate`.
     *
     * @return a new instance of [GLWorld] configured with Rubic cube cubes.

     * specified by the contents of [mPermutation] we assign a new layer based on the contents of
     * the respective index entry contained in [mCurrentLayerPermutation] (the permutation of the
     * just completed rotation). Then we assign our temporary `newPermutation` to [mPermutation]
     * and call our method [updateLayers] to apply this layer assignment to all the `Layer.mShapes`
     * objects in the [Layer] objects in [mLayers].
