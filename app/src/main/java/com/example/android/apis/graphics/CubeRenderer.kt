     * Since this method is called at the beginning of rendering, as well as every time the EGL
     * context is lost, this method is a convenient place to put code to create resources that

     * context is lost. Textures are an example of a resource that you might want to create here.
     *
     * Note that when the EGL context is lost, all OpenGL resources associated with that context
     * will be automatically deleted. You do not need to call the corresponding "glDelete" methods
     * such as glDeleteTextures to manually delete these lost resources.
     *
     * First to improve performance we disable the GL_DITHER GL capability (dithers color components
     * or indices before they are written to the color buffer). Next we specify implementation
     * specific hint GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT (Indicates the quality of color and texture
     * coordinate interpolation) with the mode GL_FASTEST (The most efficient option should be
     * chosen). If this instance was created with useTranslucentBackground true we specify the clear
     * value for the color buffers to be all 0, and if false we specify the clear value for the
     * color buffers to be all 1. Next we enable the GL capability GL_CULL_FACE (cull polygons based
     * on their winding in window coordinates), set the shade model to GL_SMOOTH (smooth shading),
     * and finally enable the GL capability GL_DEPTH_TEST (do depth comparisons and update the depth
     * buffer).
