         * check to make sure `newTab` is not null throwing an [IllegalStateException] complaining
         * "No tab known for tag [tabId]".
         *
         * Then we check if `newTab` is equal to our [mLastTab] field and do nothing more if it is.
         * Otherwise we check whether `ftVar` is null and initialize it by using our [FragmentManager]
         * field [mManager] to being a new [FragmentTransaction]. Then is our [mLastTab] field is
         * not null, and the `fragment` property of [mLastTab] is not null we instruct `ftVar` to
         * detach that fragment from the UI.
         *
         * We now branch on whether the `fragment` property of `newTab` is null:
         *
         *  - `fragment` property is null: we set it to the [Fragment] returned by the `instantiate`
         *  method when asked to instantiate a fragment with the class given by the `name` property
         *  of the `clss` property of `newTab` using the `args` property of `newTab` as the fragment
         *  argument [Bundle], and then use `ftVar` to add that fragment into the view with the
         *  ID of our [mContainerId] field using the `tag` property of `newTab` as the tag name.
         *
         *  - `fragment` property is not null: we use `ftVar` to re-attach the [Fragment] given by
         *  the `fragment` property of `newTab`.
         *
         * Finally we return `ftVar` to the caller.
         *
         * @param tabId tab ID of the tab and associated [Fragment] we want to switch to.
         * @param ft    if non-null this is a [FragmentTransaction] we should append commands to.
         *
         * @return a [FragmentTransaction] which includes the commands necessary to switch tabs.
